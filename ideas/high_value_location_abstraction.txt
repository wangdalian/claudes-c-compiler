HIGH PRIORITY: Introduce ValueLocation abstraction for eventual register allocation

Problem:
CodegenState (codegen_shared.rs:24) hardwires value_locations: HashMap<u32, StackSlot>.
calculate_stack_space_common unconditionally assigns every IR value a stack slot --
there is no liveness analysis, no register allocation, no "keep in register" path.
The x86 backend uses pushq %rax / popq %rax as scratch register management (14+
push/pop sites). ARM and RISC-V use mov x1,x0 / mv t1,t0 for the same purpose.

The ArchCodegen trait has 118 methods, all assuming stack-slot-based value locations.
The three backends total ~7,800 lines of codegen, all built on this assumption.
Every new IR instruction or optimization that the compiler adds deepens the
commitment to stack-only codegen.

What to do (incremental, not a rewrite):
1. Introduce a ValueLocation enum:
     enum ValueLocation {
         Stack(StackSlot),
         Register(PhysReg),  // for future use
     }
2. Change value_locations to HashMap<u32, ValueLocation>
3. Initially, all values still get ValueLocation::Stack -- behavior unchanged
4. Update emit_load_operand / emit_store_result to dispatch on ValueLocation
5. This creates the abstraction boundary so that a future register allocator
   can assign ValueLocation::Register to some values without rewriting all
   118 trait methods at once

This is NOT implementing a register allocator. It's adding the abstraction layer
that makes a register allocator possible without a full codegen rewrite. The longer
this is deferred, the more codegen code hardwires stack assumptions.

Key files:
- src/backend/codegen_shared.rs (CodegenState, StackSlot, calculate_stack_space_common,
  ArchCodegen trait: 118 methods)
- src/backend/x86/codegen/codegen.rs (2,391 lines, 14+ pushq %rax sites)
- src/backend/arm/codegen/codegen.rs (2,747 lines)
- src/backend/riscv/codegen/codegen.rs (2,690 lines)

Relationship to ideas/register_allocator.txt:
That idea describes the full register allocator. This idea is the prerequisite
abstraction step that should happen first.
