Project Testing Status Tracker
===============================
Format: [project] - ARM: pass/fail, x86: pass/fail, riscv: pass/fail, i686: pass/fail. Notes: any notes

zlib - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: core compression library
lua - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: scripting language
libsodium - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: crypto library
mquickjs - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: fail. Notes: JS engine, pre-existing i686 failure
libpng - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: PNG library
jq - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: JSON processor
libjpeg - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: JPEG library
mbedtls - ARM: pass, x86: fail, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: TLS library, pre-existing x86 failure, riscv now passes
libuv - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: async I/O
libffi - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: fail, i686: pass. Notes: pre-existing riscv failure
musl - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: fail. Notes: pre-existing i686 failure
tcc - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: tiny C compiler
fastlz - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: FIXED i686 - was failing due to F64 skip-slot bug
mruby - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: FIXED - build scripts rewrote to not need ruby/rake
spng - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: PNG library
mupdf - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: FIXED - preprocessor #include inside multi-line expression
squashfuse - ARM: pass, x86: pass, riscv: pass, i686: pass. Notes: FIXED - was failing due to linker arg ordering
SWI-Prolog - ARM: fail, x86: fail, riscv: fail, i686: fail. Notes: x86 compiles but crashes at boot (runtime codegen bug), needs GMP=OFF. Fixed preprocessor chained macros, TLS PIC model, and static init address-of bugs.
