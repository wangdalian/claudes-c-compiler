RESOLVED: PostgreSQL bootstrap / initdb issues

Multiple issues were identified and fixed:

1. typedef pointer array sizeof bug (commit 870d8de) - attrtypes[40] was
   allocated only 8 bytes instead of 320 bytes because sizeof for arrays of
   typedef'd pointer types was computed incorrectly.

2. -Wl, linker flags silently discarded (commit e1844e0) - The -W warning flag
   catch-all matched -Wl,--export-dynamic before the -Wl, handler, causing
   the postgres binary to be linked without --export-dynamic. This meant
   dynamically loaded extensions (.so files) couldn't resolve symbols like
   CurrentMemoryContext, causing initdb to fail when loading dict_snowball.so.

With both fixes applied, PostgreSQL initdb completes successfully.
