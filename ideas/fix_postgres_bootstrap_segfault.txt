RESOLVED: PostgreSQL bootstrap / initdb issues

Multiple issues were identified and fixed:

1. typedef pointer array sizeof bug (commit 870d8de) - attrtypes[40] was
   allocated only 8 bytes instead of 320 bytes because sizeof for arrays of
   typedef'd pointer types was computed incorrectly.

2. Global struct pointer BSS size bug - `struct Foo *ptr` globals got BSS
   allocation of sizeof(struct Foo) instead of sizeof(pointer), causing BSS
   symbols to overlap and corrupt heap-allocated strings like file paths.
   Fix: add `|| is_pointer` check in actual_alloc_size computation.

3. -Wl, linker flags silently discarded - The -W warning flag catch-all
   matched -Wl,--export-dynamic before the -Wl, handler. Fix: move -Wl,
   handler before -W catch-all.

4. -rdynamic flag silently ignored - needed for dlopen'd shared libraries
   (like dict_snowball.so) to resolve symbols. Fix: forward to linker args.

With all fixes applied, PostgreSQL initdb completes successfully.
