Fix ARM codegen crash in oniguruma's regexec.c (blocks jq regex tests on ARM)

Problem:
- jq's regex test() crashes on ARM when patterns use character class matching
  (e.g., ".", "[a-z]", ".*") but works for literal patterns ("hello", "h").
- The crash is in oniguruma's match_at function in regexec.c (~6700 lines).
- The same code works correctly on x86 and RISC-V, so it's ARM-specific.
- Building with -O0 still crashes, so it's not an optimization bug.
- Compiling regexec.c with GCC and linking with our compiler works fine.

Root cause:
- Unknown. Not the struct-by-value bug (that was fixed separately).
- Likely a code generation bug triggered by the huge match_at function,
  possibly in switch statement handling, jump table generation, or another
  ABI/register usage issue specific to very large functions.

Debugging approach:
1. Bisect regexec.c by compiling half with gcc, half with ccc-arm
2. Look at the match_at function's switch statement (95 cases)
3. Check if computed gotos or large switch tables trigger a bug
4. Compare generated assembly for the OP_ANYCHAR case (line 707)
5. Use qemu-aarch64 -g for GDB debugging to find exact crash location

Impact:
- jq passes 11/12 tests on ARM, only regex test() fails
- All 12 tests pass on x86 and RISC-V
