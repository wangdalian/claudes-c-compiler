MEDIUM PRIORITY: Extract dominator tree and CFG utilities into shared analysis module

Problem:
mem2reg privately computes a full dominator tree (Cooper-Harvey-Kennedy), CFG
predecessor/successor lists, reverse postorder, and dominance frontiers -- then
discards all of it. These are all private functions in mem2reg.rs (lines 307-533):
  build_label_map, build_cfg, compute_dominators, compute_reverse_postorder,
  compute_dominance_frontiers, build_dom_tree_children, intersect

The optimization pass pipeline (passes/mod.rs) is a hardcoded for-loop with no
shared analysis. When GVN is extended to dominator-based (its own TODO says this),
it will need to recompute the same dominator tree that mem2reg just built and
threw away. Same for LICM, loop detection, and any future dominator-based pass.

There is no AnalysisManager, no analysis caching, no invalidation protocol.
Pass ordering is manual with no dependency checking. The run_passes function
ignores the change counts returned by each pass (no convergence detection).

What to do (two steps):
Step 1 - Extract shared analysis utilities:
  1. Create src/ir/analysis.rs (or src/ir/analysis/ module)
  2. Move build_cfg, compute_dominators, compute_reverse_postorder,
     compute_dominance_frontiers, build_dom_tree_children to it as pub functions
  3. Define DomTree struct holding idom array and children list
  4. Define CFG struct holding preds and succs Vec<Vec<usize>>
  5. Update mem2reg to use the shared module
  6. ~230 lines of code to relocate, zero logic changes

Step 2 - Basic analysis caching (optional, for later):
  1. Add AnalysisCache struct that holds Option<DomTree>, Option<CFG>
  2. Passes request analyses from the cache; cache computes on first request
  3. When a pass mutates the IR, it marks the cache as dirty
  4. This prevents recomputation when consecutive passes need the same analysis

Step 1 is a prerequisite for dominator-based GVN (ideas/medium_global_gvn.txt)
and any future pass that needs dominator or CFG information.

Key files:
- src/ir/mem2reg/mem2reg.rs (lines 307-533: 6 private analysis functions)
- src/passes/mod.rs (run_passes: hardcoded loop, ignores change counts)
- src/passes/gvn.rs (TODO comment: "requires dominator tree analysis")
- src/driver/driver.rs (lines 328-332: pipeline orchestration)
