Documentation Verification (2026-01-29, updated)
=================================================

All README.md files and ideas/*.txt files have been audited for correctness.

Fixes Applied (round 1, 2026-01-29):
- README.md: -dumpversion output corrected from "6.5.0" to "6" (matches actual code)
- README.md: test count updated from "~690" to "~718" directories
- README.md: added note that i686/ lacks its own README.md
- src/frontend/README.md: sema description updated to note it now emits some errors
- src/common/README.md: added missing temp_files.rs to module listing
- src/backend/README.md: trait method count corrected from "~58" to "~55" defaults
- src/passes/README.md: pipeline description updated to include div_by_const pass
  and note that GVN+LICM+IVSR share CFG analysis
- ideas/register_allocator.txt: updated from "three backends" to "four backends"
- ideas/reduce_stack_frame_size_for_postgres.txt: updated from "three" to "four"
- ideas/high_use_def_chains.txt: updated pass pipeline description from 4 to 14 passes

Fixes Applied (round 2, 2026-01-29):
- README.md: removed outdated i686 README exception (i686/ now has its own README.md)
- README.md: test count updated from "~718" to "~724" directories
- src/backend/f128_softfloat.rs: doc comment corrected from "~10" to "~34" primitives
- src/driver/README.md: clarified that -Werror/-Wall are functional, only unrecognized
  flags are silently ignored (was misleadingly saying "-W warnings" are ignored)

Verified Correct (no changes needed):
- Cargo.toml binary targets match README description
- Architecture tree listing in README matches actual directory structure
- All 14 optimization pass files exist as documented
- Pass pipeline runs 3 iterations as documented
- All backend files match their README listings
- F128SoftFloat trait has exactly 34 arch-specific primitives (now matches doc comment)
- RISC-V callee-saved registers (s1, s7-s11 = 6) match documentation
- Frontend module descriptions (preprocessor, lexer, parser, sema) are accurate
- IR lowering file listing (~42 files) matches actual directory
- mem2reg module files match documentation
- Testing commands in README are accurate
- All 17 README.md files use consistent markdown formatting

Fixes Applied (round 3, 2026-01-29):
- README.md: test count updated from "~724" to "~736" directories
- src/backend/README.md: clarified generate_function/instruction/terminator as
  internal (private) helpers, only generate_module() is public
- src/backend/README.md: clarified common.rs emit_section_group/emit_init_data/
  emit_symbol_directives/emit_zero_global as internal helpers
- src/common/README.md: clarified eval_const_binop_i128 is internal, not public API

Fixes Applied (round 4, 2026-01-29):
- README.md: test count updated from "~736" to "~762" directories
- src/backend/README.md: added missing x86_common.rs module documentation
  (shared x86/i686 register names, condition codes, inline asm template parsing)

Known Stale (informational snapshots, not fixing):
- ideas/fix_remaining_{arm,x86,riscv}_tests.txt: pass rate numbers from 2026-01-25
  likely improved since then, but these are historical snapshots
- ideas/fix_remaining_i686_projects.txt: some internal pass rates may be outdated
- Runtime claims (kernel boots, PostgreSQL passes) cannot be verified from code alone
