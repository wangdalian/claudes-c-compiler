Complex Number Support (_Complex)

A large number of test failures (100+ tests) are due to missing _Complex type support.
This requires:

1. Lexer: Support imaginary literal suffixes: 1.0i, 1.0iF, 1.0iL
   These are GCC extensions for _Complex_I literal syntax.

2. Parser: _Complex type specifier is already partially handled (skipped).
   Need to properly track it as a type modifier.

3. IR/Lowering: Complex numbers are pairs of floats/doubles.
   Operations (+, -, *, /) need to be lowered to their component operations.

4. This would unlock ~100+ test cases that currently fail.

Priority: HIGH (unlocks the most test failures after basic arithmetic)
