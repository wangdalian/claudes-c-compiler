MEDIUM PRIORITY: Replace String block labels with integer block indices in the IR

Problem:
BasicBlock::label is String. Terminator::Branch/CondBranch/IndirectBranch all store
String labels. Phi incoming edges are Vec<(Operand, String)>. Every pass that needs
a CFG must call build_label_map() to create HashMap<String, usize>. Both mem2reg
and phi_eliminate independently build this same map. There are 67 .clone() sites
across the codebase cloning labels into terminators, phi edges, and successor lists.

The only consumer that genuinely needs the String label is the backend codegen,
which formats it into assembly text. All other uses (CFG edges, dominators, phi
predecessors) would work with integer block indices.

What to do:
1. Change Terminator branches to store BlockId(u32) instead of String
2. Change Phi incoming to Vec<(Operand, BlockId)>
3. Store the String label once per BasicBlock (for assembly emission only),
   or generate it on-the-fly during codegen from the block index
4. Remove build_label_map() -- block index IS the identity
5. Update the ~67 clone sites to use Copy-able BlockId values
6. Update lowering to emit BlockId references (fresh_label returns BlockId,
   keeps a label string table for debug/asm purposes)

Benefits:
- Eliminates all String hashing, allocation, and comparison for CFG traversal
- CFG successor/predecessor lookup becomes direct array indexing, not HashMap lookup
- BlockId is Copy, eliminating 67 .clone() sites and the Vec<String> allocations
- Phi nodes become cheaper (no String per incoming edge)
- Removes the fragility of silently-stale string references after block removal

Key files:
- src/ir/ir.rs (BasicBlock, Terminator, Instruction::Phi)
- src/ir/mem2reg/mem2reg.rs (build_label_map, build_cfg, get_successor_labels)
- src/ir/mem2reg/phi_eliminate.rs (builds its own label_to_idx map)
- src/ir/lowering/stmt.rs (40 label clones)
- src/ir/lowering/expr.rs (11 label clones)
- src/backend/codegen_shared.rs (emits labels to assembly)
