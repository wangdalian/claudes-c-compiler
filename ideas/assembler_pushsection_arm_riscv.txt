Add .pushsection/.popsection support to ARM and RISC-V assemblers

The x86 and i686 assemblers fully support .pushsection/.popsection/.previous
directives via a section_stack in the ELF writer. The ARM and RISC-V assemblers
completely lack this functionality.

This is needed for libraries that use .pushsection to emit metadata annotations
(e.g., libsodium, libffi, kernel builds with certain configurations).

Implementation approach:
- Add PushSection/PopSection variants to AsmStatement/AsmDirective for ARM/RISC-V
- Parse .pushsection/.popsection/.previous in the ARM and RISC-V parsers
- Add section_stack field to ARM and RISC-V ElfWriter structs
- Handle the directives in process_statement/process_statements

This is a moderate-priority assembler cohesion improvement.
