LOW PRIORITY: Structured error infrastructure follow-ups

COMPLETED (2026-01-28):
- Created DiagnosticEngine in common/error.rs with Diagnostic, Severity, source snippets
- Wired into parser: all 4 eprintln! error sites replaced with emit_error()
- Wired into sema: errors and warnings go through DiagnosticEngine
- Wired into preprocessor: #warning collected as warnings (not bare eprintln!)
- Driver threads DiagnosticEngine through parser -> sema pipeline
- Source snippet rendering with caret/underline using SourceManager::get_source_line()
- GCC-compatible output format: "file:line:col: error: message"

REMAINING FOLLOW-UPS:
1. Add spans to sema errors/warnings (currently use error_no_span/warning_no_span)
2. Add spans to preprocessor errors (#error directives)
3. Wire DiagnosticEngine into IR lowering phase (standalone eprintln! with no buffering)
4. Add -Werror support (treat warnings as errors)
5. Add -Wall, -Wno-* flag granularity for warning categories
6. Add error codes (like GCC's -Werror=... or Clang's -W...)
7. Remove the legacy `errors: Vec<String>` from sema (currently kept for backward compat)
8. Consider adding "note:" follow-up messages for context (e.g., "previous declaration was here")

Key files:
- src/common/error.rs (DiagnosticEngine, Diagnostic, Severity)
- src/common/source.rs (SourceManager with line map, get_source_line for snippets)
- src/frontend/parser/parser.rs (uses emit_error/emit_warning)
- src/frontend/sema/sema.rs (uses diagnostics.error_no_span/warning_no_span)
- src/frontend/preprocessor/preprocessor.rs (collects errors and warnings Vecs)
- src/driver/driver.rs (creates and threads DiagnosticEngine through phases)
