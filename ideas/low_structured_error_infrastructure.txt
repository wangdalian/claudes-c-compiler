LOW PRIORITY: Wire up the structured error infrastructure

Problem:
Error reporting uses 5 different ad-hoc patterns across compilation phases:
1. Parser: bare eprintln! + manual error_count integer, no spans
2. Sema: eprintln! immediately + push to Vec<String> that nobody reads
3. Preprocessor: #error pushed to Vec<String> driver never checks; #warning to eprintln!
4. IR lowering: standalone eprintln! with no buffering
5. DiagnosticEngine/Diagnostic in common/error.rs: span-aware, severity-tagged,
   note-capable, buffered -- but entirely dead code (never instantiated by any phase)

The DiagnosticEngine already supports:
- Diagnostic with severity, message, span, and notes
- emit() method that resolves span to file:line:col
- print_all() for deferred batch rendering
- has_errors() / error_count() queries

But it has no source-snippet rendering (no caret, no context line, no underline).
SourceManager has the file content to do this, but no code extracts source lines.

What to do (incremental):
1. Wire DiagnosticEngine into the driver -- create one instance, thread it through
   each phase (or use a global/thread-local)
2. Have the parser emit Diagnostics instead of eprintln! (parser already tracks
   token positions via Span)
3. Have sema emit Diagnostics instead of eprintln! + warnings Vec
4. Have the preprocessor report errors through DiagnosticEngine
5. Have the driver check for errors after each phase and print_all at the end
6. Add source-snippet rendering to Diagnostic::emit() -- extract the source line
   from SourceManager, print a caret/underline under the span

This is low priority because the compiler works correctly without it -- users just
get unhelpful error messages. It becomes higher priority when adding better parse
error recovery or type-checking diagnostics.

Key files:
- src/common/error.rs (DiagnosticEngine, Diagnostic -- dead code)
- src/common/source.rs (SourceManager, has file content for snippets)
- src/frontend/parser/parser.rs (eprintln! sites: lines 122, 182, 546, 695)
- src/frontend/sema/sema.rs (eprintln! + warnings Vec, lines 433-454)
- src/frontend/preprocessor/preprocessor.rs (errors Vec, eprintln! for #warning)
- src/driver/driver.rs (never reads preprocessor.errors() or sema_result.warnings)
