Function Pointer Indirect Calls

The parser now correctly parses function pointer declarations, but the lowering
doesn't properly handle indirect function calls through function pointers.

Currently, when a variable `f` holds a function pointer and we call `f(x, y)`,
the lowering treats `f` as a direct function name rather than a pointer value
that needs to be loaded and used as an indirect call target.

Fix needed in ir/lowering/lowering.rs:
- In the FunctionCall lowering, check if the callee is a local variable
  (function pointer) rather than a direct function name
- Generate an indirect call instruction
- The x86 codegen needs `call *%rax` instead of `call funcname`

This would fix tests using function pointers as parameters.

Priority: MEDIUM (affects ~10-20 tests)
