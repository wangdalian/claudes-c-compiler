Fix remaining i686 project failures
=====================================
Date: 2026-01-28 (updated after complex long double fix)

Current status (after complex long double component size fix):
- Unit tests: ~95.5% pass (10% sample: 2615/2737)
- Projects passing: 4/12 (zlib, lua, libpng, libuv)
- Projects failing: libsodium, mquickjs, jq, libjpeg, mbedtls, libffi, musl, tcc

Fixed in latest round:
- _Complex long double imaginary part offset: was 16 (x86-64), now 12 (i686)
  This was the root cause of most complex number test failures
- Lua now passes (was failing before complex fix indirectly)
- libuv now passes

Known remaining issues:

1. mquickjs crashes with SIGSEGV
   - All test_*.js tests segfault
   - Need to debug under GDB to find specific crash point

2. musl: Build fails during assembly of i386 math routines
   - Error in src/math/i386/rintl.c (or .s file)
   - May need i686-specific inline assembly handling

3. tcc: Some tests fail

4. libffi: Likely needs i686-specific ABI handling for foreign function interface

5. mbedtls: Fails after build (possible runtime crash)

6. libsodium: Timeouts and segfaults
   - Some tests timeout (possible infinite loop in crypto code)
   - Some tests segfault

7. libjpeg: Fails (possible ABI issue)

8. jq: 1/12 pass, rest fail with SIGABRT or SIGSEGV

Top failing test categories (by tag, 10% sample):
- complex-assignment: 71.4% fail rate
- complex-array: 68.0% fail rate (still some issues)
- pointer-to-complex: 64.5% fail rate
- signed-long-long: 41.9% fail rate (possible 64-bit integer bugs)

Priority investigation targets:
- signed-long-long failures (might fix more project tests)
- remaining complex failures (complex-assignment, complex-array)
- mquickjs (JS engine, exercises many codegen paths)

Techniques:
- Compare i686 assembly output against x86-64 for suspect functions
- Use GDB to trace execution and find divergence points
- Run unit test suite to find specific failing test categories
