HIGH PRIORITY: Expand sema to produce a typed AST, reducing lowering responsibilities

Current state (after TypeContext move and type_checker addition):
The sema pass collects type information (typedefs, struct layouts, enum constants,
function signatures) and now has ExprTypeChecker for CType inference. It does NOT yet:
- Annotate AST nodes with inferred types (typed AST)
- Reject type errors with diagnostics
- Replace the lowerer's expr_types.rs entirely (lowerer still needs its own
  get_expr_ctype for lowering-specific state like locals/globals)

The lowerer (ir/lowering/) is ~18K lines and handles both type inference AND IR
emission. Key type-inference code that should move to sema:

1. Expression type inference (expr_types.rs, ~1200 lines)
   - get_expr_type(): determines IrType of any expression
   - get_expr_ctype(): determines CType of any expression using lowering state
   - struct_value_size(): checks if expression produces struct value
   The lowerer's version needs locals/globals; sema's ExprTypeChecker uses
   SymbolTable instead. As sema's type tracking becomes complete, the lowerer
   can delegate more to sema.

2. Constant expression evaluation (const_eval.rs, 969 lines)
   Both sema and lowering have const_eval. Sema's is simpler (for enum values,
   array dimensions). Lowering's handles more cases (global initializers,
   sizeof of complex types). These should be unified.

3. Type conversion duplication (DONE - unified via TypeConvertContext trait)
   The type_spec_to_ctype dispatch was unified into type_builder.rs.

4. C type arithmetic (DONE - moved to CType methods)
   usual_arithmetic_conversion(), integer_rank(), is_unsigned() are now CType
   methods in common/types.rs, shared by both sema and lowering.

5. Declaration analysis (lowering.rs analyze_declaration, ~200 lines)
   Computes DeclAnalysis from type specifiers. This is type analysis, not IR.

Incremental approach:
Step 1: (DONE) Move TypeContext to sema/type_context.rs
Step 2: (DONE) Add ExprTypeChecker in sema/type_checker.rs with infer_expr_ctype()
        - CType arithmetic (usual_arithmetic_conversion etc.) moved to CType methods
        - ExprTypeChecker uses SymbolTable + TypeContext + FunctionInfo
        - Sema now resolves typeof(expr) via ExprTypeChecker
Step 3: Have sema annotate expressions with CTypes during its walk
        - Add a HashMap<ExprId, CType> or modify AST nodes to carry type info
        - Populate during analyze_expr using ExprTypeChecker
Step 4: Have lowerer consume sema's type annotations instead of re-computing
        - Lowerer's get_expr_ctype delegates to sema annotations when available
        - Falls back to its own inference only for lowering-generated expressions
Step 5: Move constant evaluation to sema (unify the two const_eval implementations)
Step 6: Add actual type error diagnostics in sema
Step 7: Simplify lowering to assume types are correct

Benefits:
- Type errors become diagnostics instead of IR lowering panics
- Lowering shrinks from ~18K to ~12K lines
- Clearer module boundary: sema validates, lowering emits
- Enables future type-system features (generics, better error messages)
