Project Verification Triage
============================

Status of all 16 verification targets as of 2026-01-25.
Failures are based on running verify_*.py scripts.

PASSING (14):
  - zlib:          PASS (all backends)
  - lua:           PASS (all backends)
  - libsodium:     PASS (all backends — fixed GEP fold i128 bug)
  - mquickjs:      PASS (all backends)
  - libpng:        PASS (all backends — fixed ARM build by not defining __ARM_NEON)
  - libjpeg-turbo: PASS (all backends)
  - sqlite:        PASS (all backends, 622/622 sqllogictest)
  - libuv:         PASS (all backends)
  - redis:         PASS (all backends)
  - libffi:        PASS (all backends)
  - musl:          PASS (all backends)
  - tcc:           PASS (all backends)
  - jq:            PASS (all backends — fixed exponential const eval hang)
  - mbedtls:       PASS (all 7 tests — fixed peephole bswap store forwarding bug)

FAILING:
  liburing:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Builds but all 5 runtime tests fail. io_uring_queue_init
           returns -1 (EPERM). This is likely a Docker/kernel limitation
           rather than a compiler bug.
    Action: Low priority. Verify by running the test with GCC-compiled
            binary — if it also fails, this is an environment issue.

  postgres:
    Status: MOSTLY FIXED (213/216 tests pass)
    Notes: Fixed sizeof() on unsized arrays (declared with []) returning pointer
           size (8) instead of actual array size. The bug was in fixup_unsized_array
           which updated alloc_size but not c_type, leaving it as Array(elem, None).
           sizeof_identifier for globals preferred c_type, and Array(_, None).size_ctx()
           returned 8. This caused pg_char_to_encoding's lengthof(pg_encname_tbl) to
           return 0, making all encoding lookups fail and initdb crash.
           Previously also fixed typedef pointer cast arithmetic (132 failures).
           Remaining 3 failures:
           1. stats_ext: statistics estimation difference (100 vs 1000)
           2. plpgsql: stack depth exceeded (recurse test)
           3. One test triggers segfault (signal 11)
    Action: Investigate stats_ext estimation and stack depth issues.

PRIORITY ORDER for fixing:
  1. Fix remaining postgres failures (stats_ext, plpgsql, segfault)
  2. Verify liburing is an environment issue
