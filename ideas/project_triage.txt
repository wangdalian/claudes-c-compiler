Project Verification Triage
============================

Status of all 16 verification targets as of 2026-01-25.
Failures are based on running verify_*.py scripts.

PASSING (14):
  - zlib:          PASS (all backends)
  - lua:           PASS (all backends)
  - libsodium:     PASS (all backends — fixed GEP fold i128 bug)
  - mquickjs:      PASS (all backends)
  - libpng:        PASS (all backends — fixed ARM build by not defining __ARM_NEON)
  - libjpeg-turbo: PASS (all backends)
  - sqlite:        PASS (all backends, 622/622 sqllogictest)
  - libuv:         PASS (all backends)
  - redis:         PASS (all backends)
  - libffi:        PASS (all backends)
  - musl:          PASS (all backends)
  - tcc:           PASS (all backends)
  - jq:            PASS (all backends — fixed exponential const eval hang)
  - mbedtls:       PASS (all 7 tests — fixed peephole bswap store forwarding bug)

FAILING:
  liburing:
    Status: FAIL (all backends)
    Notes: Builds but all 5 runtime tests fail. io_uring_queue_init
           returns -1 (EPERM). This is likely a Docker/kernel limitation
           rather than a compiler bug.
    Action: Low priority. Verify by running the test with GCC-compiled
            binary — if it also fails, this is an environment issue.

  postgres:
    Status: MOSTLY FIXED (211/216 tests pass)
    Notes: Fixed typedef pointer cast arithmetic bug that caused 132 test
           failures. The bug was in expr_is_pointer() which didn't resolve
           typedef'd pointer types through the typedef table, causing
           ((TypedefPtr) p) - 1 to subtract 1 byte instead of sizeof(struct).
           This corrupted postgres trigger event chunk pointers, manifesting
           as "could not open relation with OID 108544" errors.
           Remaining 5 failures:
           1. create_function_c, misc_functions: "ENOENT" instead of
              "No such file or directory" in error messages
           2. psql: output truncation or psql binary issue
           3. stats_ext: statistics estimation difference (100 vs 1000)
           4. plpgsql: stack depth exceeded (recurse test)
    Action: Investigate strerror/ENOENT issue and stats_ext difference.

PRIORITY ORDER for fixing:
  1. Fix remaining postgres failures (strerror ENOENT, stats_ext, plpgsql)
  2. Verify liburing is an environment issue
