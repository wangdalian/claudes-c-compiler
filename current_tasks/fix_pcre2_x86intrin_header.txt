Task: Fix pcre2 project compilation by adding bundled x86intrin.h header

Problem: pcre2's sljit JIT backend includes <x86intrin.h> when __CET__ is defined.
Our compiler defines __CET__=3 but doesn't provide x86intrin.h, so the GCC system
header is used instead. That header pulls in AVX/XOP intrinsics with __m256 types
that our compiler doesn't support, causing 557 parse errors.

Fix: Add a bundled x86intrin.h that just includes our immintrin.h (which covers
SSE through AES-NI). This intercepts the GCC system header and provides only
the intrinsics we actually support.

Status: in_progress
