Task: Fix double-brace initialization of struct with _Complex member
Status: in_progress

Problem:
When initializing a struct containing a _Complex member with double braces like:
    typedef struct { long double _Complex c; } v_test_t;
    v_test_t v = {{1.0L + 2.0Li}};
The compiler incorrectly treats the inner braces as a sub-aggregate initializer,
trying to decompose the _Complex type into real/imaginary parts as if it were a struct.
This produces garbage values.

In C, _Complex types are scalar types, not aggregate types. The inner braces
should be treated as "braces around scalar initializer" (with a warning, as GCC does).

Fix: In the initializer lowering code, when encountering a brace-enclosed initializer
for a scalar type (including _Complex), consume and ignore the extra braces rather
than treating it as aggregate initialization.

This fixes the only remaining x86 test failure (compiler_suite_0147_0070).
