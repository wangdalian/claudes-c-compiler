Extract shared linker infrastructure from all 4 backends into a common module.

Key work:
- Unify ELF64 object parser (x86, arm, riscv have nearly identical parse_object)
- Extract common linker types (OutputSection, GlobalSymbol, DynStrTab)
- Extract shared utilities (map_section_name, align_up, load_file, load_archive, merge_sections)
- Remove duplicated ELF constants from i686 linker
- Standardize naming across backends
