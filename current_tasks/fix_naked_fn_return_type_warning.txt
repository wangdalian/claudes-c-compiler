Task: Suppress -Wreturn-type warning for __attribute__((naked)) functions
Status: in_progress
Description: Naked functions have their bodies entirely in inline assembly. The -Wreturn-type warning
"control reaches end of non-void function" is spurious for naked functions because control flow is
managed by the asm. GCC does not warn about this. Fix: add !func.attrs.is_naked() check to the
-Wreturn-type condition in sema.rs. This fixes MicroPython x86 build which uses naked nlr_push().
