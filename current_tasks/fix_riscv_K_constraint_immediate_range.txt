Fix RISC-V 'K' inline asm constraint immediate range

The 'K' constraint letter has different meanings per architecture:
- x86: 0-255 (unsigned byte)
- RISC-V: 0-31 (5-bit unsigned CSR immediate for csrs/csrc/csrw)

Currently constant_fits_immediate_constraint() in inline_asm.rs uses the x86
range (0-255) for all architectures. This causes RISC-V CSR instructions like
"csrs 0x10a, 128" to be emitted with out-of-range immediates (128 > 31),
making the assembler fail with "improper CSRxI immediate".

The fix: make the K constraint range architecture-aware. On RISC-V, K = 0..31.
This affects kernel file: arch/riscv/kernel/cpufeature.c which uses the csr_set()
macro with "rK" constraint and value 128 (ENVCFG_CBZE = 1 << 7).

Status: in_progress
