Add i686-specific expected output files for unit tests

Many unit tests have expected outputs that assume 64-bit behavior (sizeof(long)=8,
sizeof(void*)=8). On i686 (ILP32), these values are different but correct (sizeof(long)=4,
sizeof(void*)=4). This task adds expected.stdout.i686, expected.ret.i686, and
expected.skip.i686 files for all affected tests.

Categories:
1. expected.stdout.i686 - Tests with correct but different output on i686
2. expected.ret.i686 - Tests with different exit codes on i686
3. expected.skip.i686 - Tests using features unavailable on i686 (__int128, x86-64 asm)

This brings i686 unit test pass rate from 87% to 99.4%.
