Task: Optimize compiler speed - peephole optimizer and IR passes

Target: Reduce compile time for large files like sqlite3.c

Key bottlenecks identified via perf profiling:
1. peephole_optimize: 9.26% of total time
   - Heavy string allocation (one String per asm line)
   - HashMap/HashSet in global_store_forwarding
   - Repeated full passes even when no changes occur
2. max_value_id: 1.46% - scans all IR instructions each call
3. malloc/free: ~15% combined - high allocation pressure
4. String::clone: 1.24%, CType::clone: 0.81%

Planned optimizations:
- Cache max_value_id on IrFunction with next_value_id counter
- Replace HashMap/HashSet in peephole global_store_forwarding with flat arrays
- Combine multiple peephole sub-passes into single-pass processing
- Reduce string allocations in peephole by borrowing original assembly
- Early-exit when no changes detected in peephole pass iterations
