Task: Fix x86 assembler error for kernel defconfig in standalone mode

Find and fix exactly one x86 assembler error that causes kernel defconfig
to fail in standalone assembler mode but pass with gcc_assembler.

Approach: Compare assembly output between gcc and standalone assembler,
identify byte-level differences, and fix the root cause.
