Task: Fix LICM load hoisting regression causing infinite loops

Problem:
The LICM pass (commit 7bd1987) introduced load hoisting that incorrectly hoists
loads from allocas that ARE modified in the loop body through derived pointers
(GEPs). This causes infinite loops because the loop condition variable is loaded
once in the preheader and never re-read.

Root cause (two defects):
1. analyze_loop_memory records store ptr VALUE IDs, not alloca bases. When a store
   goes through a GEP (store val, %gep where %gep = GEP %alloca, offset), only
   %gep is recorded, not %alloca. So is_load_hoistable thinks the alloca is unmodified.

2. The address_taken check in is_load_hoistable is gated on has_calls. Even when
   an alloca is address-taken (its address escapes via GEP), the load is still
   hoistable if there are no calls. But the loop body can modify memory through
   the escaped pointer without any calls.

Fix:
1. Remove the has_calls gate on the address_taken check - if an alloca is
   address-taken, never hoist loads from it (conservative but safe).
2. Also trace store pointers back through GEPs/Copies to find base allocas.

This fixes the LICM regression that causes hangs in tcc, jq, sqlite, and others.
