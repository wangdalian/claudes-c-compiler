Task: Fix RISC-V peephole copy propagation corrupting symbol names
Status: in_progress
Agent: Claude (Claude Opus 4.6)

Problem:
The RISC-V peephole copy propagation pass corrupts symbol names in lla/la
instructions. When propagating register copies, the replace_whole_word function
treats '.' as a word boundary, so register names inside symbol names like
"main.s1.0" get replaced. For example:

    mv t0, s1         ; copy propagation sees t0 = s1
    lla t0, main.s1.0 ; replace_whole_word replaces 's1' with 't0'
                      ; producing: lla t0, main.t0.0

This causes undefined reference errors at link time because the corrupted
symbol name doesn't exist.

Fix:
1. Treat lla/la instructions specially - skip copy propagation for them
2. Also fix replace_whole_word to consider '.' and '_' as word characters
   since they appear in symbol names

Affected tests: compiler_suite_0137_0315 (and potentially others)
