Fix x86 emit_select not using LEA for alloca conditions

Bug: In the x86 backend's emit_select function, when loading the condition
operand into %rdx, the code always uses movq (load value) regardless of
whether the value is an alloca. For alloca values (like array addresses),
it should use leaq (load effective address) instead.

This causes arrays used in boolean/logical contexts (e.g., `arr && x`) to
read uninitialized stack contents instead of computing the array's address,
leading to nondeterministic behavior.

Fix: Add is_alloca check in emit_select's condition loading path, matching
the pattern used in value_to_reg and other operand loading functions.

Affected test: compiler_suite_0053_0032 (tests -09, -10)
Status: in_progress
