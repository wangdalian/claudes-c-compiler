Fix _Generic type association parsing and abstract declarator improvements

Problem 1: _Generic expression type associations only parse pointer modifiers (*)
but not array modifiers ([N]) or the full abstract declarator syntax. This means
types like `int[4]` in `_Generic(a, int[4]:2, default:5)` fail to parse.

Fix: Replace the inline pointer-only parsing in parse_generic_selection() with
a call to parse_abstract_declarator_suffix(), which already handles pointers,
arrays, parenthesized declarators, and function pointers.

Problem 2: sizeof with complex abstract declarators like `double(*([3][4]))[2]`
fails because try_parse_paren_abstract_declarator() only understands pointer
groups like (*), not array-of-pointer groups like ([3][4]).

Fix: Extend the abstract declarator parsing to handle array dimensions inside
parenthesized groups.

Affected tests:
- c_testsuite_00219 (_Generic with int[4])
- wacc_chapter_17_valid_sizeof_sizeof_derived_types (sizeof with complex types)

Affects all three architectures since this is a frontend/parser issue.

Status: in progress
