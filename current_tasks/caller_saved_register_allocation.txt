Task: Add caller-saved register allocation for values not spanning function calls

Currently the register allocator only assigns callee-saved registers (rbx, r12-r15
on x86) to values whose live ranges cross function calls. Values that don't cross
calls get zero register allocation and bounce through the stack via %rax/%rcx.

This task adds a second allocation phase that assigns caller-saved registers
(rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, r8-r11) to eligible values that do NOT span any call.
Since these values never cross a call, the caller-saved registers don't need
save/restore. This eliminates the vast majority of stack traffic in hot loops.

Profiling shows this is the single highest-impact codegen optimization:
- CCC's zlib minigzip is 6.7x slower than GCC -O2
- Hot functions (deflate_slow, slide_hash) show ~30 stack bounces per loop iteration
  vs GCC's 0 stack accesses in the inner loop

Approach:
1. Extend RegAllocResult to include caller-saved assignments
2. Add a second linear-scan pass for caller-saved registers
3. Update all three backends (x86/ARM/RISC-V) to use the new assignments
4. Keep the same store_rax_to / operand_to_rax fast-paths for assigned values

Status: in_progress
