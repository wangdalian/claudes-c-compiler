Fix ARM codegen: promoted GP param registers clobbered before ParamRef reads them

When a GP parameter's alloca is promoted by mem2reg and the param's ParamRef dest
is assigned to a callee-saved register, emit_store_gp_params skips the parameter
(no spill to stack). Later, emit_param_ref reads directly from the ABI register
(e.g., x0). But between prologue and ParamRef, other body code (including other
ParamRef emissions) uses x0 as the accumulator, clobbering the original value.

Example: eval_poly(double x, const double *coefs, int n)
- d0 = x, x0 = coefs, x1 = n
- Phase 2 spills d0 via fmov x9, d0 (safe, uses x9)
- Body code emits ParamRef for x: fmov x0, d0 + store_x0_to -> clobbers x0
- ParamRef for coefs later tries to read x0 -> gets garbage

Fix: In emit_store_gp_params, when resolve_param_slot returns None, save the ABI
register directly to the callee-saved register in the prologue, before any body
code can clobber it. Same for FP params in emit_store_fp_params.
