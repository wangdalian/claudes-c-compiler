Fix: _Generic selection CType resolution for typeof()

Problem: When typeof() wraps a _Generic expression, get_expr_ctype_lowerer() has no
handler for Expr::GenericSelection. This causes it to return None, the sema fallback
also fails (pointer-identity lookup misses for typeof-embedded exprs), and
resolve_typeof() falls back to TypeSpecifier::Int. This means pointer types get
resolved as int (4 bytes instead of 8), truncating 64-bit pointers.

Impact: Linux kernel READ_ONCE() macro uses typeof(_Generic(x, ..., default: (x)))
to determine the volatile load type. When x is a pointer (e.g. struct list_head*),
the compiler generates a 32-bit movslq instead of a 64-bit mov, truncating the
pointer and causing kernel page faults.

Fix: Add Expr::GenericSelection arm to get_expr_ctype_lowerer() in expr_types.rs,
mirroring the existing resolve_generic_selection_type() logic but returning
Option<CType> via get_expr_ctype() on the selected expression.

Status: IN PROGRESS
