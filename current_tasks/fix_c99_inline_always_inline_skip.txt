Fix C99 inline always_inline functions being skipped during lowering

Problem:
C99 inline functions (inline without static/extern) that have __attribute__((always_inline))
are completely skipped during IR lowering (line 685-686 of lowering.rs: `continue`).
This means their function body is never available for the inliner, so calls to them
become undefined references at link time.

Example:
  inline __attribute__((always_inline)) int my_func(void) { return 42; }
  int main(void) { return my_func(); }  // undefined reference to my_func

This is correct for plain C99 inline functions (they don't provide an external definition),
but when always_inline is set, the compiler MUST inline them and thus needs their body.

Fix: When a C99 inline-only function has always_inline, still lower it but mark it as static
(internal linkage) so no external definition is emitted but the body is available for inlining.

Affected projects: cute_headers, and likely many others using always_inline without static.
