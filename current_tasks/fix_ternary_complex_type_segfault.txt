Fix ternary expression segfault with complex types

Bug: When a ternary expression (cond ? a : b) has complex type operands where
one branch is a variable and the other is a function call, the generated code
segfaults. The true branch incorrectly uses `lea` to get the address and then
`cvtsi2sd` to convert that address to a float, instead of loading the complex
value from memory. This results in garbage pointer values that cause a segfault
during the subsequent `rep movsb` memory copy.

Reproducer:
    _Complex float xf = 12345.0f + 123456.0f * I;
    _Complex float make_cf(void) { return 100.0f + 200.0f * I; }
    int cond = 1;
    _Complex float result = cond ? xf : make_cf();  // SEGFAULT

Status: in_progress
