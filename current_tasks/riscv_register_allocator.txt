COMPLETED: RISC-V Register Allocator - Linear Scan with Callee-Saved Registers

Implemented a linear scan register allocator for the RISC-V backend that assigns
frequently-used IR values to callee-saved registers (s1, s7-s11) instead of
always spilling everything to the stack.

Implementation:
1. src/backend/liveness.rs - Live interval computation for IR values
2. src/backend/regalloc.rs - Linear scan register allocator
3. src/backend/riscv/codegen/codegen.rs - RISC-V integration:
   - operand_to_t0: reads from callee-saved register when available
   - store_t0_to: write-through to both stack slot AND callee-saved register
   - calculate_stack_space: runs register allocator after stack layout
   - emit_prologue: saves callee-saved registers
   - emit_epilogue/emit_epilogue_and_ret: restores callee-saved registers

Safety measures:
- Disabled for functions with inline assembly or atomics
- Disabled for functions with loops (back-edges in CFG) due to linear liveness limitation
- Only allocates for simple instruction types (BinOp, UnaryOp, Cmp, Cast, Load, GEP)
- Excludes float, i128, and long double types
- Write-through strategy ensures stack always has correct value
- Excludes s2-s6 (used as temporaries in emit_call_reg_args)

Test results (RISC-V, ratio 10): 2830/2861 (98.9%) - matches baseline exactly, 0 regressions.
