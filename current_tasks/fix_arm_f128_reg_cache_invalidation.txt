Task: Fix ARM f128 register cache invalidation after constant loading
Status: completed
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: In the shared F128 soft-float orchestration, loading an f128 constant
clobbers the accumulator register (ARM: x0/x1) with constant data, but the
register cache is not invalidated. Subsequent operand_to_x0 calls get a stale
cache hit (thinking x0 still holds the previous value) and skip the load.
This causes expressions like `2.0L * (long double)i` to produce 0.0.

Fix: Add reg_cache.invalidate_all() after constant loading in three shared
orchestration paths in f128_softfloat.rs:
- f128_operand_to_arg1 (constant path)
- f128_store_to_slot (constant path)
- f128_store_to_addr_reg (constant path)

Result: ARM test suite gains 1 passing test (2851->2852), no regressions on
any architecture. All 36 project builds pass.
