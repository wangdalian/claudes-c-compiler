Task: Optimize phi elimination to avoid unnecessary temporary values

Status: in_progress

Problem:
The current phi elimination pass creates temporary values for ALL phi edges when a block
has multiple phis. This causes massive code bloat and stack traffic in functions with large
switch statements (like sqlite3VdbeExec), because each phi copy goes through an intermediate
stack slot: src -> tmp_slot -> dest_slot.

For sqlite3VdbeExec: CCC generates 1.6MB of code vs GCC's 40KB (42x bloat).
SQLite speedtest: CCC 10.5s vs GCC 0.87s (12x slower).

Solution:
Implement smart phi elimination that analyzes which phi copies actually need temporaries
(only when there are circular dependencies like swap patterns) and uses direct copies for
the rest. This eliminates one stack load/store per non-conflicting phi per predecessor edge.

Also extend the copy coalescing in stack_layout to handle cross-block phi copy pairs where
the temporary is only used once.
