Task: Eliminate push/pop accumulator pattern in x86 binop/cmp codegen

Problem: emit_int_binop and emit_cmp use a 7-instruction push/pop pattern for every
binary operation:
  operand_to_rax(lhs)   # load lhs into rax
  pushq %rax            # save lhs to stack
  operand_to_rax(rhs)   # load rhs into rax
  movq %rax, %rcx       # move rhs to rcx
  popq %rax             # restore lhs from stack
  <op> %rcx, %rax       # perform operation
  movq %rax, slot       # store result

This is 7+ instructions per binop. The fix:
1. Add operand_to_rcx() that loads directly to %rcx, skipping the push/pop dance
2. Use immediate operands for constant RHS where possible (addq $4, %rax)
3. Same pattern for emit_cmp (load lhs to rax, rhs to rcx, cmpq %rcx, %rax)
4. Fix emit_float_binop/emit_cmp float paths to avoid push/pop

Expected: 3-4 fewer instructions per binop/cmp, major code quality improvement.

Scope: x86 codegen only (emit_int_binop, emit_cmp, + helper methods)

Related: optimize_x86_immediate_operands.txt covers immediate operand optimization.
This task is broader - it eliminates the entire push/pop pattern for the common case.

Status: in progress
