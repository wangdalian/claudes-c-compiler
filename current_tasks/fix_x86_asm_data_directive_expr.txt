Fix x86 assembler: data directive expressions with constant + symbol

The x86 standalone kernel build fails because .long directives with expressions
like `0x9b000000 + pa_real_mode_base` are not properly parsed. The assembler
should parse this as symbol `pa_real_mode_base` with addend `0x9b000000` and
emit a R_X86_64_32 relocation. Currently it treats the whole expression as
a literal string, producing an UNKNOWN relocation type.

This blocks arch/x86/realmode/rm/reboot.o and wakeup_asm.o builds, preventing
the x86 standalone kernel from completing.

Fix: Update the x86 assembler's data directive expression parser to handle
expressions of the form `constant + symbol` (and `symbol + constant`).
