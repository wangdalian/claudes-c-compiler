Task: Fix x86-specific test arch tagging
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: Many x86-specific tests (containing x86 inline assembly, x87/SSE
instructions, x86 register names, etc.) are missing the -x86 suffix in their
directory name. The test framework uses this suffix to skip architecture-
inappropriate tests, so these tests incorrectly run on ARM and RISC-V backends,
causing ~14-15 false failures per backend.

Fix: Rename these test directories to add the -x86 suffix, and regenerate
expected outputs. Also tag long-double precision tests that specifically test
x87 80-bit semantics as x86-only.

Expected impact: ARM pass rate: ~95.3% -> ~97.5%+, RISC-V: ~95.6% -> ~97.5%+
