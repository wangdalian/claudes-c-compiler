Task: reduce_stack_frame_sizes
Status: in_progress
Description: Implement liveness-based stack slot reuse to reduce stack frame sizes.

Problem: Our compiler generates stack frames 2-6x larger than GCC for many functions.
This causes postgres plpgsql stack depth test to fail (recursive functions exhaust the
2048kB stack limit). For example, exec_stmt_block uses 1128 bytes (CCC) vs 344 bytes (GCC),
and exec_stmt_fori uses 728 bytes (CCC) vs 120 bytes (GCC).

Root cause: Every IR value that spans multiple basic blocks gets its own permanent 8-byte
stack slot. The existing block-level coalescing only handles values defined and used within
a single block. Values that cross block boundaries never share stack space, even when their
live ranges don't overlap.

Fix: Use the existing liveness analysis (LiveInterval from liveness.rs) to identify
non-overlapping live intervals for non-alloca values. Values whose live ranges don't
overlap can share the same stack slot. This is an interval graph coloring problem,
similar to register allocation but for stack slots.

Expected impact: Should significantly reduce frame sizes for medium-to-large functions,
fixing the postgres plpgsql test and generally improving stack usage across all programs.
