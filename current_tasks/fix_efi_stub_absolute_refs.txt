Task: Fix EFI stub absolute symbol references causing link failure
Status: in_progress

Problem:
When compiling drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/gop.c with ccc, the resulting object
file contains absolute symbol references that are not allowed in the EFI stub.
The EFI stub requires position-independent code (compiled with -mcmodel=small or
equivalent), but our compiler emits absolute movabs/mov instructions or R_X86_64_64
relocations instead of RIP-relative addressing.

Error: "drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/gop.stub.o: absolute symbol references not allowed in the EFI stub"

Approach:
1. Compare gcc and ccc object files for gop.c to identify the specific absolute references
2. Fix the code generation to use RIP-relative addressing where needed
3. Verify fix by re-running the bisect test
