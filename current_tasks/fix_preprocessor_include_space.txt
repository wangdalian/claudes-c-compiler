Fix preprocessor: strip spaces from macro-expanded include paths

When #include uses a macro that expands to <tokens>, spaces between tokens
are preserved in the include path. For example:
  #define incdir tests/
  #define funnyname 42test.h
  #define incname < incdir funnyname >
  #include incname
produces path "tests/ 42test.h" instead of "tests/42test.h".

The existing normalize_include_path() only handles the narrow "/ /" pattern.
Fix: extend it to strip all spaces from the include path.
