Fix preprocessor # (stringification) operator not escaping double-quotes inside char literals

Bug: When the # operator stringifies a macro argument containing a char literal
with a double-quote character (e.g., assert(*p == '"')), the double-quote
inside the char literal is not escaped in the output string. This produces
a malformed string literal like "*p == '"'" instead of the correct
"*p == '\\\"'".

This breaks Redis's bundled lua_cjson.c which uses assert(*json->ptr == '"').

Fix location: src/frontend/preprocessor/macro_defs.rs, stringify_arg function,
char literal handling branch (lines 869-894).

Root cause: The char literal handler escapes backslashes but not double-quote
characters. Per C11 6.10.3.2, all " and \ in the token sequence must be
preceded by \ in the stringified result.
