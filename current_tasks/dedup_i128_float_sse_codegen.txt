Task: Deduplicate i128 binop/cmp, float binop, and SSE op codegen across backends

The three backend codegen files (x86: 2499 lines, arm: 2716 lines, riscv: 2674 lines) contain
massive duplication in several methods that share identical algorithmic structure but differ only
in register names and instruction mnemonics.

Plan:
1. Extract emit_i128_binop into a shared trait default that dispatches to per-op arch primitives
   (~418 lines of duplicated code across 3 backends)
2. Extract emit_i128_cmp into a shared trait default with arch-specific compare/set primitives
   (~150 lines duplicated)
3. Extract emit_float_binop into a shared trait default with FP register move primitives
   (~76 lines duplicated)
4. Extract emit_x86_sse_op dispatch structure into shared trait default
   (~592 lines duplicated)

Expected savings: ~600-800 lines of code removed while improving maintainability.
