Fix assignment LHS evaluation order: evaluate LHS lvalue address before RHS side effects.

Bug: In `a[i] = i++`, the compiler evaluated the RHS (i++) first, then used
the post-incremented i for the array index. This caused out-of-bounds writes
that corrupted the stack frame pointer (rbp), leading to segfaults.

Fix: In lower_assign(), compute the LHS lvalue before evaluating the RHS
expression. This matches GCC -O0 behavior.
