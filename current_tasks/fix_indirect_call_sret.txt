Fix indirect call struct return (sret) handling

The jq project's map/select test fails because function calls through
function pointers that return structs larger than 16 bytes (or 2 registers)
don't properly use the sret calling convention. This causes wrong results
when jq's 16-byte jv type is returned through indirect calls.

The fix needs to:
1. Detect when an indirect call returns a struct that needs sret
2. Pass the sret pointer as an implicit first argument
3. Read the return value from the sret buffer after the call
