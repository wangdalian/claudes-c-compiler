Optimize preprocessor to eliminate excessive heap allocations.

Key changes:
1. Convert expand_text and related functions from Vec<char> scanning to byte-oriented scanning
   - expand_text: replace chars().collect() with as_bytes() iteration
   - expand_function_macro helper functions: same treatment
   - extract_trailing_ident: operate on bytes directly
2. Optimize __LINE__ macro to avoid per-line MacroDef allocation/deallocation
3. Optimize strip_line_comment to return Cow<str> instead of always allocating
4. Reduce identifier extraction allocations by working with byte slices

Profiling shows ~17% of compile time in malloc/free/realloc, with the preprocessor
being the largest contributor. The Vec<char> conversion pattern is the most common
allocation hotspot.
