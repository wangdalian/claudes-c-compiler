Task: Major backend deduplication and lowering.rs split

1. Extract duplicated code from x86/arm/riscv backends into shared modules:
   - Common assembler (parameterized by toolchain command)
   - Common linker (parameterized by toolchain command and flags)
   - Shared data emission (globals, string literals, const data) into backend/common.rs

2. Add a Backend trait to unify codegen/assembler/linker dispatch in the driver

3. Split lowering.rs (2552 lines) into:
   - lowering.rs (core orchestration + function lowering)
   - expr.rs (expression lowering)
   - stmt.rs (statement lowering)
   - types.rs (type conversion helpers)

4. Add README.md files to each major subdirectory

Status: In progress
