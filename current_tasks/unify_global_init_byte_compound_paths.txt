Task: Unify global_init_bytes.rs and global_init_compound.rs

The lowering module has two parallel paths for struct/union global initialization:
1. global_init_bytes.rs (1,330 lines) - byte-buffer serialization for simple cases
2. global_init_compound.rs (1,681 lines) - relocation-aware compound path for pointer cases

Both implement the same algorithm (iterate items, resolve fields, handle designators,
recurse into nested structs/arrays, handle bitfields) but produce different output formats.

Plan: Introduce an InitOutput trait that abstracts the output target, then merge the two
implementations into a single generic algorithm. This should eliminate ~800-1000 lines of
duplicated code.
