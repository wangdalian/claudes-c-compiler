Task: Fix parser, comparison, shift sizeof, and compound literal issues

Fixes:
1. Parser: struct/union function pointer field declarations (int (*name)(params))
2. Lexer: C99 hex/octal literal type promotion (unsigned int for values > INT_MAX)
3. IR: comparison type uses common_ty for correct 32-bit signed/unsigned cmp
4. sizeof_expr: left-shift result type is promoted left operand only
5. Global compound literal: &(struct S){...} creates anonymous global
6. Compound init: nested struct list initializer serialization in compound globals

Tests fixed: c_testsuite 89, 104, 149, 150, 200
Score: c_testsuite 204/220 (up from 199/220)
