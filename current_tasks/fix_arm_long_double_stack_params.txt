Fix ARM (AArch64) long double (F128) stack parameter passing in callee

Bug: When more than 8 long double params are passed to a function on AArch64,
the callee's emit_store_params incorrectly handles overflow F128 params:

1. Classification: stack_offset only increments by 8 for overflow float params,
   but F128 needs 16 bytes and 16-byte alignment.
2. Loading: Phase 3 loads stack params with a single 8-byte ldr, but F128 params
   need 16 bytes loaded (and then converted from f128 to f64 via __trunctfdf2).

The caller (emit_call) correctly handles this with 'S' class, but the callee
doesn't distinguish F128 stack overflow from regular float stack overflow.

Status: LOCKED
