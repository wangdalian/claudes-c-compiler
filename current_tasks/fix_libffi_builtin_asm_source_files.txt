Fix libffi build with MY_ASM=builtin on x86

Problem: assemble_source_file() in external_tools.rs doesn't handle MY_ASM=builtin.
When MY_ASM=builtin is set, it tries to run a literal "builtin" command instead of
using the builtin assembler. This causes libffi's .S files (unix64.S, win64.S) to
fail assembly.

Fix: When MY_ASM=builtin is set in assemble_source_file():
1. Read the .s/.S file content
2. For .S files, preprocess using our internal preprocessor
3. Pass preprocessed text to the target's builtin assembler
4. Also fix any missing x86 assembler instructions/directives needed by libffi

Note: Another person is working on the same fundamental issue for musl
(fix_musl_builtin_asm_source_files.txt). These changes may overlap but this
is focused on libffi-specific .S preprocessing and assembly instructions.
