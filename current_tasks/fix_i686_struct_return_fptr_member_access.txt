Task: Fix i686 struct return via function pointer member access
Status: completed
Description: On i686, accessing a member of a struct returned through a function pointer
(e.g., fn().x where fn is passed as a parameter) incorrectly uses the stack address
instead of loading the value. The root cause is in get_struct_base_addr and
expr_produces_packed_struct_data in structs.rs which use `struct_size > 8` to determine
if a function pointer call returns an address. On i686, ALL struct returns use sret
(hidden pointer) regardless of size, so this check is wrong for small structs.

Fix: Added target_is_32bit() check so i686 always treats struct-returning function
pointer calls as returning an address (via sret), never as packed register data.

Files modified:
- src/ir/lowering/structs.rs (get_struct_base_addr, expr_produces_packed_struct_data)
- tests/i686-struct-return-fptr-member/ (new regression test)

Test results: x86 2989/2990, ARM 2855/2868, RISC-V 2857/2859, i686 2731/2737 (+1)
