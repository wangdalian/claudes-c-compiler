Task: Fix char array compound literal string initialization

Bug: Compound literals of char array type with string initializer produce garbage.
    char *p = (char[]){ "hello" };    // BROKEN - prints garbage
    printf("%s\n", (char[]){"world"});  // BROKEN - prints garbage

But these work fine:
    char a[] = "hello";          // OK
    char b[] = { "hello" };      // OK

The issue is in compound literal lowering - when the compound literal has
char array type and a string initializer, the string data isn't being
properly copied into the compound literal's stack allocation.

Fix: Find the compound literal lowering code and ensure it handles
string initializers for char array compound literals the same way
regular variable initialization handles them.

Status: IN PROGRESS
