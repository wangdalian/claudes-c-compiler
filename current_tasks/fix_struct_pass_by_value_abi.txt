Fix struct/union pass-by-value calling convention (ABI bug)

CCC passes all structs by pointer (address in a single register), but the
x86-64 SysV ABI requires structs <= 16 bytes (with all INTEGER-class fields)
to be passed by value in registers. This causes ABI incompatibility with
GCC-compiled code and is the root cause of the PostgreSQL initdb crash.

The bug manifests as:
- Struct fields get garbage values when crossing CCC/GCC compilation boundaries
- Arguments after the struct get shifted to wrong registers
- PostgreSQL's RelFileLocator (12 bytes, 3 x Oid) gets corrupted

Fix needed in:
- Backend codegen: emit_call must pack small structs into registers at call sites
- Backend codegen: function prologues must unpack register-passed structs
- Both caller and callee sides need fixing for all three backends (x86, ARM, RISC-V)

Status: LOCKED
