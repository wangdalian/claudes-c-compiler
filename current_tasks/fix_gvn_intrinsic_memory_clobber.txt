Fix GVN clobbers_memory to recognize Intrinsic instructions with dest_ptr

Status: in_progress

Problem:
The GVN pass's clobbers_memory() function does not recognize Instruction::Intrinsic
with dest_ptr: Some(_) as a memory-modifying instruction. This causes incorrect
store-to-load forwarding past non-temporal stores (movnti, movntdq, storedqu, etc.).

Example: _mm_stream_si32(&val32, 42) writes to val32 via an Intrinsic with dest_ptr,
but GVN forwards the stale initial value (0) from a prior Store.

Test: tests/sse-nontemporal-fence fails with stream_si32=0 instead of stream_si32=42.

Fix:
Add Intrinsic { dest_ptr: Some(_), .. } to the clobbers_memory match in gvn.rs.
This matches what DCE already does (line 295 of dce.rs).
