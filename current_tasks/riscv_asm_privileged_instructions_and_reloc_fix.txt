Adding missing privileged/system instructions to the RISC-V native assembler
and fixing the TLS_GOT_HI20 relocation type value bug.

Missing privileged instructions being added:
- wfi (Wait For Interrupt)
- mret (Machine-mode trap return)
- sret (Supervisor-mode trap return)
- sfence.vma (Supervisor fence for virtual memory / TLB flush)
- fence.tso (Total Store Ordering fence)

Bug fix:
- R_RISCV_TLS_GOT_HI20 was incorrectly mapped to ELF value 23 (same as PCREL_HI20).
  The correct value per the RISC-V ELF psABI is 21.
