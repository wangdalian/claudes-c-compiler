Fix _Generic selection in global/static array initializer expressions.

The _Generic expression was not being resolved in:
1. eval_const_expr() - constant evaluation path
2. eval_global_addr_expr() - global address resolution path  
3. collect_compound_init_element() - compound array element collection
4. array_needs_compound_init() - compound init detection

This caused QEMU's all_outop[] array (which uses _Generic in OUTOP macro
for designated initializers) to be zero-initialized, resulting in a SIGILL
crash at runtime when tcg_target_op_def returned C_NotImplemented (-1)
for basic opcodes like INDEX_op_st32.
