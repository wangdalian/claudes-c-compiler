Optimize callee-saved register allocation to only assign registers to values
whose live intervals span across function calls.

Previously, all eligible values could be assigned callee-saved registers
regardless of whether they crossed a call boundary. This wasted stack space
because each callee-saved register costs 8 bytes of save/restore in the
prologue/epilogue. Values that don't cross calls gain no benefit from
callee-saved registers.

The fix tracks call instruction program points during liveness analysis and
filters register allocation candidates to only those spanning calls. This
reduces stack frame sizes for leaf functions and functions with many
short-lived intermediates.
