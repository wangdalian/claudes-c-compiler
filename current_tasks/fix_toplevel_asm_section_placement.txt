Bug: Top-level asm() directives emitted in .bss section instead of .text

Status: in_progress

Problem:
Top-level asm("...") statements (file-scope asm) are emitted after the data sections
in generation.rs, but without first switching back to the .text section. This means
the asm content inherits the .bss section from the last data section emission.

This causes kernel boot failures when files like arch/x86/kernel/static_call.c
define functions via top-level asm (e.g. __static_call_return) - the function body
ends up in .bss (zero-filled) instead of .text (executable code).

Fix:
Emit ".text" before the top-level asm directives in generation.rs, so they default
to the .text section (matching GCC behavior).
