Deduplicate emit_cast and emit_return across all three backends.

Currently, emit_cast (i128 widening/narrowing/copy) and emit_return (i128/f128/f32/f64
dispatch) are copy-pasted across x86, ARM, and RISC-V codegen files with identical logic
but different register names. This refactoring extracts both as default trait implementations
in codegen_shared.rs using existing ArchCodegen primitives, eliminating ~200 lines of
duplicated code.

Also adds shared CallArgClass enum and classify_call_args() helper to reduce the
argument classification duplication in emit_call (same classification logic repeated
3 times with different char conventions).
