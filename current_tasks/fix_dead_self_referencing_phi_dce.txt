Task: Fix DCE to remove dead self-referencing phi nodes from promoted inlined allocas

Status: in_progress

Problem: The Linux kernel crashes during boot in init_scattered_cpuid_features
with a NULL pointer dereference. The function has two inlined cpuid calls inside
a loop. After inlining cpuid_count() and promoting its parameter allocas via
mem2reg, dead phi nodes are created at the loop header for the parameter
pointer values. These phis have self-referencing incoming values
(phi V: [entry: 0, backedge: V]) which prevents DCE from removing them
because the self-reference keeps the use count at 1.

The dead phi's copies (writing 0 from the entry/continue paths) corrupt the
inline asm output pointer stack slots via Tier 2 liveness packing, causing
NULL pointer dereferences when the cpuid output values are stored through
these corrupted pointers.

Root cause: In dce.rs, the use-count based DCE doesn't handle self-referencing
phi nodes. A phi that only references itself has use_count=1 (from its own
incoming value), so DCE considers it "live" even though no other instruction
uses it. This causes dead phi copies to be emitted during phi elimination,
which overwrite inline asm output pointer slots.

Fix: Make DCE not count self-references when building phi use counts.
When a phi's incoming value is its own dest, that use should be excluded
from the use count. This allows the phi to be recognized as dead (use_count=0)
and removed, preventing the corrupting copies from being emitted.

Impact: Fixes x86 defconfig kernel boot (NULL deref in init_scattered_cpuid_features).
