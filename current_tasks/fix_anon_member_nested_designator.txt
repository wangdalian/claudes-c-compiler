Fix anonymous member nested designator initialization in global/static struct init.

Bug: When a flattened designator like `.base.cra_name = "val"` targets a field inside
an anonymous struct/union member, the compiler dropped the remaining designator chain
(e.g., `.cra_name`) when creating the synthetic init item for the anonymous member.
This caused values to be written at wrong offsets within the sub-struct.

Affected: crypto/crypto_null.c, drivers/acpi/acpi_processor.c,
arch/x86/boot/compressed/ident_map_64.c (all fail kernel bisect)

Fix: Preserve all remaining designators when creating synthetic init items for
anonymous member resolution in global_init_compound.rs, global_init_bytes.rs,
global_init_helpers.rs, and stmt.rs.

Status: completed
