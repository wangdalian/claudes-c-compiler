Add numeric label resolution to i686 assembler for cohesion with x86

The x86 assembler has comprehensive numeric label support (1:, 2:, 1f, 1b, etc.)
via resolve_numeric_labels() pre-pass and runtime numeric_label_positions tracking.
The i686 assembler shares the same parser but completely lacks this functionality,
meaning any inline assembly using numeric labels will fail or produce wrong code.

This is the most important assembler cohesion issue that is not already locked.
Will mirror the x86 implementation pattern for the i686 backend.
