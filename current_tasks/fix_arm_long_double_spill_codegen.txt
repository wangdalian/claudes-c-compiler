Fix ARM64 long double spill/reload codegen bug

Problem: When compiling code with multiple long double variables in nested loops,
the ARM64 codegen incorrectly treats spilled long double values as memory addresses.
Specifically, after storing a 128-bit long double result (from __addtf3) to a stack slot,
the code later loads 8 bytes from that same slot as a pointer (x17) and dereferences it,
causing a segfault.

Reproducer: /clean_tests/compiler_suite_0182_0018 and compiler_suite_0182_0019

Root cause: The codegen's long double expression evaluation on ARM64 confuses
stack-spilled Q-register values with memory operand addresses when register
pressure is high.
