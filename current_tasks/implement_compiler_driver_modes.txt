Implement compiler driver modes and CLI flags

Currently -S, -c, -E, -D, -I, and -g are all stub TODOs in main.rs.
This task implements proper handling of these GCC-compatible flags:

1. -S: Output assembly to file instead of compiling to executable
2. -c: Compile to object file only, don't link
3. -E: Preprocess only, output to stdout
4. -D name=value: Define preprocessor macros from command line
5. -I path: Add include search paths
6. -g: Track debug info flag (for future DWARF support)

These are foundational driver features required by the project spec.
