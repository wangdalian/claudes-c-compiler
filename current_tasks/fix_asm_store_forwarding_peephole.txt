Fix peephole store forwarding for inline asm writing to stack slots

The x86 peephole optimizer's global_store_forwarding pass failed to invalidate
slot mappings when an inline asm instruction (like movntiq) wrote to a %rbp-relative
stack slot. The instruction was classified as LineKind::Other (since movntiq doesn't
match the standard mov prefix), and the Other handler only invalidated register
mappings, not memory slot mappings. This caused subsequent loads from the same slot
to be incorrectly eliminated, reading a stale register value instead of the value
written by the inline asm.

Status: in_progress
