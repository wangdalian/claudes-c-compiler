Fix RISC-V assembler .option push/pop not saving/restoring relax state.

The .option push and .option pop directives are silently ignored in the
RISC-V assembler's elf_writer.rs. When kernel code uses:
  .option push
  .option norelax
  nop
  .option pop
the norelax state persists for the rest of the file, causing missing
R_RISCV_RELAX relocations on all subsequent CALL_PLT, PCREL_HI20, and
PCREL_LO12 instruction pairs. This causes the Linux kernel to hang
during boot on RISC-V.
