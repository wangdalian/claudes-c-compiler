Lock: fix_vector_binop_type_inference (in_progress)

Bug: Vector binary operation type inference returns scalar type instead of vector type.

When a binary operation involves a vector and a scalar (e.g., `float4_vec * float_scalar`),
get_binop_ctype calls usual_arithmetic_conversion which doesn't handle vector types. It
returns the scalar element type (e.g., Float) instead of the vector type (e.g., Vector(Float, 16)).

This causes nested vector expressions like `vec_a + vec_b * scalar_f` to miscompile:
the inner `vec_b * scalar_f` is correctly lowered to a vector alloca, but the outer `+`
sees its RHS type as scalar Float (from get_binop_ctype), so it tries to broadcast the
alloca pointer as a scalar float value, producing garbage results.

Fix: Add vector type handling to get_binop_ctype: when either operand of an arithmetic/bitwise
binary op is a vector type, return that vector type (per GCC vector extension semantics).

Affects: gifsicle (segfault in scale_image_data_mix), likely other projects using GCC vector
extensions with complex expressions.
Status: in_progress
