Fix IEEE 754 compliance in algebraic simplification pass
========================================================

Problem: The algebraic simplification pass in simplify.rs applies transformations
that are only valid for integers to floating-point types as well:

1. x + 0 => x: Wrong when x is -0.0 (result should be +0.0, not -0.0)
2. 0 + x => x: Wrong when x is -0.0 (result should be +0.0, not -0.0)
3. x * 0 => 0: Wrong for floats (NaN * 0 = NaN, -5.0 * 0 = -0.0)
4. x - x => 0: Wrong for floats (Inf - Inf = NaN)
5. x / x => 1: Wrong for floats (0/0 = NaN, Inf/Inf = NaN)

The fix will guard these simplifications so they only apply to integer types,
preserving IEEE 754 semantics for floating-point operations.

This affects all 3 architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V) since it's in the IR
optimization passes.

Test: wacc_chapter_19_whole_pipeline_all_types_fold_negative_zero fails on all arches.
