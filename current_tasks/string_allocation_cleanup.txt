Task: Eliminate unnecessary String heap allocations from &'static str literals

Status: in_progress

Scope:
- Change reg_to_32, reg_to_64, reg_to_16, reg_to_8l, reg_to_8h functions in x86 and i686
  backends to return Cow<'static, str> instead of String, avoiding heap allocations
  for known register names
- Update callers to work with Cow<'static, str> return types
- Change other hot-path .to_string() on string literals to use &'static str or .into()
  where the receiving type allows it

Goal: Reduce unnecessary heap allocations in codegen hot paths while maintaining
identical behavior. Zero functional changes.
