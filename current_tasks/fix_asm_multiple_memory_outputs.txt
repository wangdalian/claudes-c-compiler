Task: fix_asm_multiple_memory_outputs
Status: in_progress
Description: Fix inline assembly with multiple "=m" memory output operands.

Bug: When inline assembly has multiple "=m" (memory output) operands, all
operands get their address loaded into the same hardcoded register:
  x86: r11, ARM: x9, RISC-V: t0
The second load overwrites the first, so both memory references point to
the same (last) address. This causes writes to the wrong memory location.

Example failing test: asm-mem-output-x86-006-run2
  asm volatile (
      "mov %[ina], %[outa]\n\t"
      "mov %[inb], %[outb]\n\t"
      : [outa] "=m" (s.a), [outb] "=m" (s.b)
      : [ina] "r" (va), [inb] "r" (vb)
  );
  // s.a is never written because both %[outa] and %[outb] resolve to (%r11)

Fix: Use assign_scratch_reg() in resolve_memory_operand() instead of
hardcoding a single register. Each memory operand gets its own unique
temporary register for the address.
