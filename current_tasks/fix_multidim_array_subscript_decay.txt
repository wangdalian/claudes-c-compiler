Fix multidimensional array subscript decay in static initializers

Bug: When a multidimensional extern array is subscripted in a static initializer
and the result is a sub-array that decays to a pointer, no relocation is emitted.

Example:
  extern const u8 regs[10][16];
  struct thing t = { .ptr = regs[3] };
  // regs[3] is u8[16], decays to u8*, needs relocation regs+48
  // Was emitting zero instead of the relocation

Fix: Add ArraySubscript arm to eval_global_addr_expr() that handles
array-to-pointer decay when indexing into a multidimensional array.

Status: in_progress
