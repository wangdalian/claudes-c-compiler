Task: Fix function pointer parameter shadowing known function names
Status: in_progress

Problem: When a function has a parameter that is a function pointer with a name
that matches a known/implicit function (e.g., `void (*free)(void *)` as a parameter),
the compiler incorrectly generates a direct call to the external symbol instead of
an indirect call through the function pointer parameter.

Root cause: is_func_ptr_variable() in expr_calls.rs checked
`!self.known_functions.contains(name)` which always returned false for names like
"free" or "malloc" that are pre-registered as implicit functions in sema. This
prevented the local parameter from shadowing the known function.

Fix: When a name exists in locals, check ptr_sigs and c_type to determine if it's
a function pointer, ignoring known_functions. The known_functions check only applies
when there's no local variable with that name.

Affected: ipc/namespace.c (kernel boot failure due to undefined reference to `free`)
