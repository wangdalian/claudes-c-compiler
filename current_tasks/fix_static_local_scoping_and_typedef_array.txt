Task: Fix static local variable scoping and incomplete array typedef initialization
Status: IN PROGRESS

Problems to fix:
1. Static local variables are inserted into self.locals during declaration,
   causing their GlobalAddr to be emitted in the wrong basic block.
   When goto/switch skips the declaration, the GlobalAddr is unreachable,
   but later uses of the variable try to reference it.
   Fix: Don't insert static locals into self.locals. They are already
   handled by static_local_names + globals lookup in expr.rs and lvalue.rs.

   Affected tests:
   - wacc_chapter_10_valid_extra_credit_goto_skip_static_initializer
   - wacc_chapter_10_valid_extra_credit_switch_skip_static_initializer
   - wacc_chapter_10_valid_shadow_static_local_var

2. Incomplete array type via typedef (typedef int a[]) produces globals
   with wrong size (sizeof element instead of sizeof array) and no initializer data.
   Fix: Properly compute array size from initializer for typedefs with
   incomplete array type.

   Affected tests:
   - compiler_suite_0030_0114 (typedef int a[]; a x = {1,2,3};)

3. Additional small fixes identified during investigation:
   - Static initializer float-to-int and int-to-float conversion improvements
   - unsigned int compound assignment type conversion
