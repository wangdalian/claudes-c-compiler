Task: Fix long double literal precision - constants parsed at only f64 precision

Status: in_progress

Problem:
Long double floating-point literals (with 'L' suffix) are being parsed at only
f64 (double) precision, losing precision on all architectures:
- ARM64: long double is 128-bit IEEE quad (113-bit mantissa)
- x86: long double is 80-bit x87 extended (64-bit mantissa)
- RISC-V: long double is 128-bit IEEE quad (113-bit mantissa)

For example, 1.0000000000000000001L loses the extra digits and becomes 1.0L,
and 9223372036854775807.0L (2^63-1) becomes 9223372036854775808.0L (2^63).

Fix:
The lexer/constant evaluator needs to parse 'L'-suffixed floating-point literals
at full quad precision (or 80-bit for x86) rather than going through f64.
This requires implementing higher-precision float parsing in the frontend.

Affected tests: compiler_suite_0095_0035, compiler_suite_0016_*, compiler_suite_0059_*,
compiler_suite_0112_*, and all tests involving long double precision.
