Fix: Support $ in identifiers and add __gnu_linux__ predefined macro

1. Lexer: Allow '$' character in identifiers (GCC extension -fdollars-in-identifiers,
   enabled by default). This fixes the Gravity project which uses $expr and $value
   as C variable names.

2. Preprocessor: Add __gnu_linux__ as a predefined macro on Linux targets.
   GCC defines this on Linux/glibc. Missing it breaks femtolisp and potentially
   8 other projects.
