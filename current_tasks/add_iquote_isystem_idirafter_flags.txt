Task: Add -iquote, -isystem, and -idirafter include path flags to driver and preprocessor
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Problem:
The compiler does not support -iquote, -isystem, or -idirafter flags. When these
flags are used, the compiler silently ignores the flag name and then treats the
directory argument as a source file, causing "Cannot read: Is a directory" errors.

This breaks projects like s6 which use -iquote in their build system.

Fix approach:
1. Add parsing for -iquote, -isystem, -idirafter in driver's parse_cli_args()
2. Add quote_include_paths and after_include_paths fields to preprocessor
3. Update include resolution order in preprocessor:
   - For quoted includes: current dir -> -iquote paths -> -I paths -> -isystem paths -> default system paths -> -idirafter paths
   - For system includes: -I paths -> -isystem paths -> default system paths -> -idirafter paths
4. Treat -isystem paths like system paths (suppress warnings for headers found there)

Key files:
- src/driver/driver.rs (flag parsing)
- src/frontend/preprocessor/preprocessor.rs (path storage, add_* methods)
- src/frontend/preprocessor/includes.rs (include resolution order)
