Improve parser robustness for declaration parsing:

1. Fix function pointer parameter declarations (e.g., void (*fn)(int a))
   Currently the parser sees "(*fn)" and fails because it doesn't recognize
   parenthesized declarators in parameter lists.

2. Fix storage class specifiers appearing after the type keyword
   (e.g., "int static x;" is valid C but we only check for storage class before type)

3. Remove stale implement_struct_support.txt (already done in commit 97cab23)

These fixes will unblock ~50+ test cases that currently fail with parse errors.
