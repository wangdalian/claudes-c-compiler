Task: Fix backslash-whitespace-newline line continuation
Status: in_progress
Agent: claude

Problem: join_continued_lines() only handles backslash immediately before newline,
but GCC/Clang also accept backslash followed by whitespace before newline as valid
line continuation. This causes compilation failures for tests like compiler_suite_0059_0082.

Files to modify:
- src/frontend/preprocessor/preprocessor.rs (join_continued_lines function)
