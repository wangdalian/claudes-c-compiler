Task: Fix typedef name as label and function type parameters

Goal: Fix two parser issues:
1. Typedef names used as labels (e.g., `Ins:` where `Ins` is a typedef) should be parsed
   as labels, not declarations. Currently the parser sees a typedef name and enters
   declaration parsing, failing to recognize the label.
2. Function types used as parameter declarations (e.g., `void (Dat *)` as a parameter
   in a function declaration) should be parsed correctly as function types that decay
   to function pointers.

These issues prevent the QBE project from compiling.

Key files:
- src/frontend/parser/statements.rs (label vs declaration disambiguation)
- src/frontend/parser/declarators.rs (function type in parameter position)
