Improve register allocator cost model to reduce stack frame sizes.

Problem: The register allocator assigns callee-saved registers to values with very
short live intervals (used once, 1-2 instructions apart). Each callee-saved register
costs 8 bytes of frame space for save/restore, but short-lived values gain no benefit
from being in a register since they're consumed immediately.

This causes unnecessarily large stack frames, which triggers PostgreSQL's plpgsql
stack depth check to fail during recursion tests.

Fix:
1. Add minimum interval length threshold - only assign registers to values spanning
   more than a few instructions
2. Add cost awareness - the benefit of register assignment must exceed the 8-byte
   save/restore cost when introducing a NEW callee-saved register
3. Skip callee-saved register allocation entirely for functions with very few
   instructions where the overhead cannot possibly pay off
