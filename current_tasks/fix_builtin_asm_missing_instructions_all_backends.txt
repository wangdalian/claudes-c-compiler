Fix builtin assembler missing instructions across all backends for libffi, libsodium, musl

Issues:
- x86: missing movd, vblendps, indirect call target support
- ARM: missing ldp/stp with negative offsets, st2 instruction, expression evaluation in offsets 
- RISC-V: missing frflags instruction
- i686: missing stmxcsr instruction
- libsodium: rsize_t parse error

Goal: Make libffi, libsodium, and musl pass with MY_ASM=builtin MY_LD=builtin
