Make verify_musl.py pass with the ARM (aarch64) backend.

Issues identified:
1. ARM assembler split_on_semicolons doesn't respect // comments (also locked by fix_arm_asm_semicolon_in_comments.txt)
   - Causes failure on musl's src/ldso/aarch64/tlsdesc.s
   - Will fix this if the other task doesn't complete first
2. Potential other compilation/linking/runtime issues with musl's ARM assembly files
3. Potential issues compiling musl C source files with the ARM backend
