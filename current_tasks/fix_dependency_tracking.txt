Task: Fix Dependency Tracking (-M/-MD/-MMD)

Status: in_progress

Problem:
The -MD/-MMD dependency file output doesn't track actually-included headers.
The preprocessor processes #include directives but doesn't collect the set of
included files. The driver's write_dep_file() method only writes "output: input\n"
without any header dependencies, making Make/build system integration broken.

Plan:
1. Add included-file tracking to the preprocessor (collect all files opened via #include)
2. Pass the collected header list from preprocessor through the pipeline to the driver
3. Update write_dep_file() to emit all included headers in the dependency output
4. Support -M (deps only, no compile), -MM (skip system headers), -MP (phony targets)
5. Ensure the Linux kernel build still works with the improved dependency output
