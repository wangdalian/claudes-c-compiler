Fix two bugs in global initializer system for nested struct/union pointer fields:

1. Nested struct init list pointer collection: When a struct field initialized with
   a braced list (e.g., .inner = { .fn1 = hello, .fn2 = world }) is part of a global
   array, the pointer relocations were not collected. Added collect_ptr_ranges_from_struct_init_list
   to scan nested struct init lists recursively for pointer and function-pointer fields.
   Also integrated with collect_ptr_ranges_from_nested_init to handle nested designators
   within those lists.

2. Nested member access chain in address-of: &global.a.b expressions (multi-level
   member access through structs) were not resolved as global address offsets.
   Added resolve_member_access_chain to recursively compute cumulative byte offsets
   through chains of MemberAccess expressions, using struct layouts to find field
   offsets at each level.

These fixes are needed for Redis startup (server config initialization uses deeply
nested struct/union designated initializers with function pointers and address-of
nested global struct members).
