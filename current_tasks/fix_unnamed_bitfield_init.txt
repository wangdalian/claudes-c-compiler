Task: Fix unnamed bitfield initialization
Status: IN PROGRESS

Problem:
Unnamed bitfields (e.g., `unsigned int :3`) are incorrectly receiving initializer values
during struct initialization. According to C11 6.7.9p9, unnamed members of struct types
do not participate in initialization.

Root Cause:
1. StructLayout::for_struct() includes unnamed bitfields (non-zero width, empty name)
   in the field_layouts list - this is correct for layout computation but causes issues
   for initialization.
2. resolve_init_field_idx() does not skip unnamed bitfields when doing positional init.
   It returns current_idx directly, which may point to an unnamed bitfield.

Fix:
Modify resolve_init_field_idx() to skip over unnamed bitfield fields (name is empty
AND bit_width is Some) during positional initialization.

This should fix ~36 compiler_suite_0013 test failures plus potentially other bitfield tests.

Affected files:
- src/common/types.rs (resolve_init_field_idx)
