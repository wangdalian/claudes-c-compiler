Implement -shared library linking and informational flags (-dumpmachine, --version)

Problem: Redis build fails because xxhash's shared library (.so) build uses
`-shared` flag which our compiler doesn't support. The compiler also doesn't
handle `--version` or `-dumpmachine`, causing spurious "no input files" errors.

Changes needed:
1. Add `shared` field to Driver struct
2. Parse `-shared` flag to set it
3. In link_with_args, pass `-shared` to gcc and skip `-no-pie` when building .so
4. Implement `--version` and `-dumpmachine` to print appropriate info and exit 0
5. These are needed for redis xxhash dependency to build correctly

Impact: Unblocks redis build (xxhash shared library), and improves
compatibility with build systems that check compiler identity.
