Fix sqlite sort order corruption: CASE WHEN with subquery comparison corrupts sort direction.

49 of 622 sqlite sqllogictest cases fail because a CASE expression containing
a subquery comparison (e.g., c>(SELECT avg(c) FROM t1)) in an ORDER BY context
corrupts an internal sort direction flag, causing subsequent ORDER BY expressions
to sort in reversed (DESC) order.

The bug is in the compiler (not sqlite) - GCC-compiled sqlite produces correct
results. The likely cause is a miscompilation of comparison return values,
struct field access (KeyInfo.aSortFlags), or register clobbering during
CASE/subquery evaluation that corrupts the sorter's direction state.
