Task: Implement _Complex type support
Status: IN PROGRESS

Goal: Add basic _Complex number support to unlock 1000+ failing test cases.

Plan:
1. Add ComplexFloat, ComplexDouble, ComplexLongDouble to CType enum
2. Update parser to properly build Complex types (currently skips _Complex)
3. Add __real__ and __imag__ unary operators to lexer/parser/AST
4. Add imaginary literal suffixes (1.0i, 1.0fi, 1.0li) to lexer
5. Add complex.h header support (creal, cimag, etc.)
6. Lower complex types in IR as struct {real, imag} pairs
7. Implement complex arithmetic (+, -, *, /)
8. Implement complex type conversions and assignments

Approach:
- Complex types stored as two-element structs internally
- Operations decomposed into component-wise operations on real/imag parts
- creal/cimag implemented as field access on the internal struct
- __real__/__imag__ are unary prefix operators (GCC extension)
