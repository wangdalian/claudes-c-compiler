Task: Fix ImageMagick compilation - noreturn attribute leak + ARM branch range

Two compiler bugs fixed:
1. Parser: __attribute__((noreturn)) in comma-separated declarations leaked to
   subsequent declarators (e.g. extern void fatal() __attribute__((noreturn)), warning();
   incorrectly marked warning() as noreturn too)
2. ARM peephole: fuse_branch_over_branch collapsed safe trampoline patterns into
   bare b.cond instructions that could exceed the ±1MB range limit on large functions

Also requires check_arm.sh and check_riscv.sh build script fix: add -no-pie to LDFLAGS
