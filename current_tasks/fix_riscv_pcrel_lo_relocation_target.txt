Fix RISC-V assembler pcrel_lo12 relocation to reference the auipc label
instead of the target symbol directly.

The R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I and R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_S relocations must reference
a local label placed on the corresponding AUIPC instruction (which has the
R_RISCV_PCREL_HI20 relocation), NOT the target symbol itself.

Currently, both pcrel_hi20 and pcrel_lo12 reference the target symbol (e.g.,
"global"), causing the linker error:
  "dangerous relocation: %pcrel_lo missing matching %pcrel_hi"

This accounts for ~96% of all RISC-V builtin assembler test failures.

The fix involves:
1. In ElfWriter, when processing WordsWithRelocs containing a pcrel_hi20+pcrel_lo12
   pair, create a synthetic local label at the auipc offset
2. Rewrite the pcrel_lo12 relocation to reference that synthetic label
3. Add the synthetic label to the symbol table so the linker can find it
