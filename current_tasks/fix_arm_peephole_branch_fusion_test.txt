Fix ARM branch-over-branch fusion: treat unknown target labels as in-range.

The peephole optimization fuse_branch_over_branch was too conservative -
when the target label wasn't found in the current snippet, it assumed
out-of-range and skipped the optimization. Since b.cond has ±1MB range
and the original unconditional branch already reached the target, we
should assume it's in range when the label isn't found locally.
