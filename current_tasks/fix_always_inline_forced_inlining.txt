Fix __always_inline forced inlining for kernel section safety

Problem: Functions marked __attribute__((always_inline)) are parsed but never force-inlined.
The current inlining pass only inlines small (<=20 instructions, 1 block) static inline functions.
This causes kernel boot failures when always_inline functions (like try_get_desc in
arch/x86/kernel/alternative.c) are called from functions in special sections (.noinstr.text).
GCC force-inlines these regardless of size, keeping them in the caller's section. Our compiler
emits them as separate functions in .text, causing objtool to reject the build or causing
boot hangs.

Fix: Extend the inlining pass to force-inline __always_inline functions:
1. Propagate is_always_inline from AST through IR
2. In the inlining pass, treat always_inline callees with much higher size limits
3. Allow multi-block always_inline functions to be inlined
4. Skip only truly impossible cases (recursive, variadic, etc.)
