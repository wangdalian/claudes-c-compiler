Task: Fix va_start struct parameter offset miscalculation
Owner: agent
Status: in-progress
Description: va_start was counting large struct params (>16 bytes) as GP register
consumers instead of stack-passed params, causing gp_offset and overflow_arg_area
to be wrong in variadic functions with struct params.
