Implementing __auto_type GCC extension support.

This blocks liburing and libuv which use GCC's stdatomic.h macros that expand
to __auto_type declarations inside statement expressions.

Plan:
- Add __auto_type as a type specifier in the parser
- Add TypeSpec::AutoType variant to the AST
- Handle type inference from the initializer during lowering
- Test with liburing and libuv projects
