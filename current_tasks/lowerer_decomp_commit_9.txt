Lowerer Decomposition Commit 9: Delete dead code and workarounds

Plan:
- Delete collect_all_enum_constants and collect_all_typedefs (now dead - sema provides these)
- Delete resolve_ctype_size, resolve_forward_declared_ctype if no longer needed
- Delete stale SemaResult fields that TypeContext replaced
- Delete any remaining dead TypeSpecifier→CType conversion helpers
- Pure deletion commit, zero semantic change

Status: IN PROGRESS
