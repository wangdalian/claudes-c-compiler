Task: Fix kernel/sched/core.c ARM miscompilation causing boot hang
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: kernel/sched/core.c causes ARM kernel boot hang (timeout after 400s)
when compiled with ccc-arm. This is separate from the sizeof(_Generic) bug 
which was fixed in commit 73d1be7.

Found via delta debugging (seed 7, total-count 500).
