Fix peephole trampoline coalescing: follow jmp targets in fall-through check

Bug: The fall-through safety check in eliminate_loop_trampolines stops at
unconditional jumps (jmp) without checking whether the jump target reads
src_fam or dst_fam. When the fall-through path ends with "jmp .exit_block"
and the exit block reads src_fam (which was NOPped by coalescing), the
exit block reads an uninitialized register.

Example pattern:
    addq $1, %r9        ; r9 = p+1 (was r11 before coalescing)
    cmpq %r8, %r9
    jb .loop_back        ; conditional back-edge
    jmp .exit_block      ; fall-through check stops here (approved!)
  .exit_block:
    movq %r11, %r12      ; r11 was never written! Should be r9

Fix: When the fall-through scan ends at an unconditional jmp, follow the
jump target and continue checking for src_fam/dst_fam reads there.

Affects: any do-while loop with pointer increment where exit uses the pointer
after the loop (e.g., count_bytes, string scanning patterns).

Status: in_progress
