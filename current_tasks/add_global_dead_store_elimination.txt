Task: Add global dead store elimination to x86 peephole optimizer

Description:
After global_store_forwarding eliminates loads from stack slots (converting them
to register-to-register moves or NOPs), many stores to those same slots become
dead. The existing eliminate_dead_stores pass only catches stores that are
overwritten by another store to the same slot within a 16-instruction window.

This task adds a function-level dead store elimination pass that:
1. Scans each function to collect all stack slot offsets that are loaded from
2. Eliminates stores to slots that are never loaded from in the entire function
3. Runs after GSF and local dead store passes to clean up remaining dead stores

This should significantly reduce stack traffic in CCC-compiled code, especially
in loops where temporary values are stored to stack but then forwarded via
registers by GSF.

Files to modify:
- src/backend/x86/codegen/peephole/passes.rs (add new pass)
