Task: Fix global constant data emission sign extension

Problem: When a compile-time cast produces a narrow IrConst (e.g., IrConst::I8(-127) from
(signed char)129), and it's stored in a wider global variable (e.g., long g = (char)129),
the emitter writes .byte instead of .xword, losing the sign extension.

Fix: In emit_const_data, use the global's declared type (ty parameter) to determine the
correct data directive width, sign-extending narrow constants to the full width.

Status: IN PROGRESS
