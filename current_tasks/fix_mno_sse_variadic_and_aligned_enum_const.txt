Task: Fix -mno-sse variadic prologue SSE instructions and aligned(enum_const) evaluation
Status: in_progress

Bug 1 (-mno-sse variadic prologue):
  When -mno-sse is set (e.g., Linux kernel build), the compiler unconditionally
  emitted movdqu instructions to save XMM registers in variadic function prologues.
  This caused invalid opcode traps in the kernel (SSE is disabled in kernel mode).

  Fix: Parse -mno-sse/-mno-sse2/-mno-mmx/-mno-avx flags and propagate a no_sse
  option through CodegenOptions to X86Codegen. When no_sse is true:
  - Skip XMM register saves in variadic prologues (only save GP registers)
  - Reserve only 48 bytes for register save area (not 176)
  - Set fp_offset to 176 in va_start so va_arg for floats always uses stack path

Bug 2 (aligned attribute with enum constants):
  __attribute__((aligned(1 << ENUM_CONST))) silently failed because the parser's
  eval_const_int_expr() had no Expr::Identifier case. Enum constants were only
  available in sema, but aligned() was evaluated at parse time.

  Fix: Add an enum_constants map to the Parser struct, populated when enum
  definitions are parsed. eval_const_int_expr_with_enums() resolves identifiers
  against this map, allowing aligned(expr) to evaluate enum-constant expressions.

Kernel bisect: kernel/workqueue.c and net/sunrpc/clnt.c now pass (both had
struct pool_workqueue __aligned(1 << WORK_STRUCT_PWQ_SHIFT) which uses enum constants).
