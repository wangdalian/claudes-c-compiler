Refactor stmt.rs: decompose mega-functions and extract shared helpers

The stmt.rs file (2092 lines) contains several extremely long functions:
- lower_local_decl: 552 lines - handles too many concerns in one function
- lower_stmt: 601 lines - massive match arms that should be separate methods
- emit_struct_init: 438 lines - deeply nested match with repeated patterns

Plan:
1. Extract lower_return_stmt (~194 lines) from lower_stmt's Return arm
2. Extract lower_switch_stmt (~100 lines) from lower_stmt's Switch arm
3. Extract lower_inline_asm_stmt from lower_stmt
4. Split lower_local_decl into: extern/func decl handling, init-from-expr, init-from-list
5. Extract duplicated function meta registration pattern (3 inline copies vs register_function_meta)
6. Extract scope-tracked removal helper (3 identical inline instances)
7. Split emit_struct_init array handling into focused helpers
8. Add README.md for ir/lowering/
