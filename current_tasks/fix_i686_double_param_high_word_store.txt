Fix i686 codegen: missing high-word store for double parameter copy

Bug: When a function takes a double parameter on i686, the codegen copies
the parameter from the stack to a local alloca. For 64-bit values (double),
this requires two 32-bit stores (low word and high word). In certain cases
(triggered by including stdlib.h + math.h with long double functions present),
the high-word store (movl %eax, -4(%ebp)) is dropped, leaving the upper
half of the double uninitialized.

Reproducer: /clean_tests/compiler_suite_0149_0011
  - f01(double) -> unsigned int returns 0 instead of 10
  - Only the low 32 bits of the double are stored; high 32 bits are garbage
