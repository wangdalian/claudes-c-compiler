Task: Add -Werror, -Wall, and -Wno-* warning flag support
Status: in_progress

Problem:
All -W* flags (except -Wl, -Wa, -Wp) are silently swallowed. The compiler has
no way to promote warnings to errors (-Werror), enable warning groups (-Wall),
or selectively disable warnings (-Wno-*). This is critical for build system
integration since projects like Linux kernel use -Werror extensively.

Plan:
1. Add WarningKind enum to common/error.rs with categories for existing warnings
2. Extend Diagnostic to carry optional WarningKind
3. Add WarningConfig to DiagnosticEngine for filtering and -Werror promotion
4. Update all warning emission sites (sema, preprocessor) with WarningKind tags
5. Parse -Werror, -Wall, -Wextra, -Wno-*, -Werror=* flags in main.rs
6. Wire config through Driver to DiagnosticEngine
7. Test with no regressions
