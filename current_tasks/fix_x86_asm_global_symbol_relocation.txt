Fix x86 assembler: preserve PLT32 relocations for global/weak symbols

The built-in x86 assembler was incorrectly resolving R_X86_64_PLT32
relocations for global/weak symbols when they were in the same section.
GCC's assembler keeps these as relocations so the linker can handle
symbol interposition and PLT redirection.

Fix: Only resolve same-section PC-relative relocations for local symbols
(internal .L* labels and STB_LOCAL symbols), not for global/weak ones.
