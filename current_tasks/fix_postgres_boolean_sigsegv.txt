Fix postgres SIGSEGV during boolean query execution

The postgres verification fails because the server crashes with SIGSEGV during
boolean queries. This is a cascading failure - once the server crashes, all
subsequent tests also fail. Currently only 43/216 tests pass.

Plan:
1. Reproduce the crash by running the postgres verification
2. Identify what query/code path triggers the crash
3. Isolate the compiler bug (likely a codegen or IR issue)
4. Fix the bug and verify postgres improves
