Task: Implement array subscript (read/write) and lvalue assignments

Currently:
- Array subscript (a[i]) always returns 0 (placeholder)
- Assignment only works for simple identifiers, not arr[i] = val or *p = val
- Compound assign / pre/post inc/dec only work for identifiers
- Short-circuit evaluation (&&, ||) not implemented (uses bitwise AND/OR)
- Declarations with array sizes don't allocate correct amount

Plan:
1. Fix array declaration to allocate element_size * array_length bytes
2. Implement GetElementPtr for array subscripts in lowering
3. Implement lvalue-aware assignments for arr[i], *p
4. Implement short-circuit evaluation for && and ||
5. Handle compound assign and pre/post inc/dec for array elements and deref
6. Update all three backends (x86, arm, riscv) as needed
