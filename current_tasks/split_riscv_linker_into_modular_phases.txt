Split the RISC-V linker's monolithic link.rs (2622 lines) into modular phases,
matching the pattern already used by ARM, x86, and i686 linkers.

Plan:
- Extract executable emission into emit_exec.rs
- Extract shared library emission into emit_shared.rs
- Keep link.rs as thin orchestration (~200-300 lines)
- Add a plt_got.rs for PLT/GOT construction helpers
- Update mod.rs and README
