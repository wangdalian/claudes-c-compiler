Task: Fix spng check_x86.sh build script

The spng x86 check script uses CMake which fails because CMake's FindZLIB
cannot locate the zlib library when using our compiler (ccc-x86 doesn't report
implicit library directories to CMake). The other arch scripts (arm, i686, riscv)
use direct compilation with miniz and work fine.

Fix: Rewrite check_x86.sh to use the same pattern as the other arch scripts -
direct compilation with miniz instead of CMake.
