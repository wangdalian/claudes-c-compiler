Fix missing ARM NEON intrinsics needed by PostgreSQL's simd.h:
- vmaxvq_u8: horizontal max across uint8x16_t vector
- vqsubq_u8: unsigned saturating subtract of uint8x16_t vectors
- vceqq_u32: compare equal of uint32x4_t vectors

These are used in src/include/port/simd.h and cause build failures
because they're treated as implicit function declarations.

Also fix any other ARM-specific issues blocking postgres build/test.
