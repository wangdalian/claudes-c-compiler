Fix improper temp file handling in driver.rs and backend/common.rs.

Currently:
- Hardcodes /tmp/ instead of respecting $TMPDIR or std::env::temp_dir()
- No cleanup on crash/error paths (temp .o files leak on failure)
- No proper temp directory abstraction

Plan:
- Use std::env::temp_dir() which respects $TMPDIR on Unix
- Add a TempFileGuard or similar RAII cleanup mechanism for crash safety
- Ensure all temp files are cleaned up on both success and error paths
