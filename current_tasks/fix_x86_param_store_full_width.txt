Task: Fix x86 emit_store_params to always write full 8-byte slots
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Problem:
emit_store_params_impl stores integer parameters with typed (narrow) instructions
(e.g., movl for I32, movw for I16), leaving the upper bytes of the 8-byte stack
slot uninitialized. Later code paths (value_to_reg) always use movq to read from
slots, reading uninitialized bytes. This causes valgrind errors (conditional jump
depends on uninitialised value) and potential correctness issues.

Fix:
In emit_store_params_impl, always store the full 64-bit register for IntReg and
StackScalar parameter classes. On x86-64, any 32-bit operation on a register
zero-extends the result to 64 bits, so the full register is always well-defined.
The typed load in emit_param_ref_impl still correctly extracts only the meaningful
bytes (e.g., movslq for I32).

Impact:
Fixes bzip2 x86 valgrind test failures. Related to fix_x86_param_ref_narrow_writeback
but addresses the root cause at the store site rather than compensating at the load site.
