Task: Remove crate-level #![allow(clippy::wrong_self_convention)] suppression

Fix all 9 instances where to_* methods on Copy types take &self instead of self.
Files affected: src/common/types.rs, src/ir/constants.rs

The fix is to change &self to self in method signatures and update method bodies
accordingly (remove dereferences where needed).
