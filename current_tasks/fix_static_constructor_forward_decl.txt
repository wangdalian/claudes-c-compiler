Fix static constructor/destructor functions not being emitted when
__attribute__((constructor)) is on a forward declaration rather than
the function definition.

The bug: when a function is declared as:
  static void f(void) __attribute__((constructor));
  static void f(void) { ... }

The constructor attribute is on the forward declaration, not the
definition. The lowering pass skipped the function as unreferenced
dead code because:
1. The FunctionDef node didn't have the constructor flag
2. The reference collector didn't treat constructors as roots

This affects the utest.h pattern used by sokol tests and other projects.
