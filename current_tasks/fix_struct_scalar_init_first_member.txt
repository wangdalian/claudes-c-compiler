Task: Fix struct initialization with scalar value for first member
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-30

Problem:
When a struct member is initialized with a scalar in a designated initializer,
C allows this and interprets it as initializing the first member of the inner
struct. For example:

  typedef struct { int a; int b; } inner_t;
  typedef struct { int x; inner_t y; } outer_t;
  outer_t o = { .x = 1, .y = 42 };  // y.a should be 42, y.b should be 0

Our compiler currently drops the scalar value (y.a ends up as 0).
GCC and Clang both handle this correctly.

This affects: yyjson project (test_json_patch fails on all 4 architectures)
