Task: Fix missing implicit argument conversions for indirect calls through complex expressions
Status: in_progress
Worker: claude-agent
Branch: master

Description:
When calling through struct member function pointers (e.g., stats->compute_stats(stats, fn, n, n)),
the compiler failed to perform implicit argument type conversions (e.g., int-to-double) because
no named function signature was available for lookup. This caused PostgreSQL's stats_ext regression
test to fail because compute_stats received garbage as its totalrows (double) parameter.

Fix: Added fallback in lower_call_arguments to extract parameter type info from the callee
expression's CType when no named function signature is available.

Files changed:
- src/common/types.rs (added get_function_type method)
- src/ir/lowering/expr_calls.rs (added extract_fn_ptr_param_info fallback)
- tests/fptr-member-implicit-int-to-double-arg/ (regression test)
