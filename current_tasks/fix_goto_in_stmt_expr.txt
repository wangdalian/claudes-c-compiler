Task: fix_goto_in_stmt_expr
Status: in_progress
Description: Fix goto inside GNU statement expressions to correctly capture the value of the
expression after the label target.

Bug: When a goto inside a statement expression jumps to a label also inside the same statement
expression, the value of the statement expression was taken from dead code (after the goto)
rather than from the expression following the label target. This caused FIND_NEXT_BIT and similar
Linux kernel macros to return wrong values.

Root cause: lower_stmt_expr() only captured expression values from Stmt::Expr nodes. When the
final expression was wrapped in Stmt::Label (e.g., `out: sz;` parsed as Label("out", Expr(sz))),
the whole thing was dispatched to lower_stmt() which discarded the expression value.

Fix: In lower_stmt_expr(), peel through Stmt::Label wrappers to find the innermost statement.
Lower each label (creating branch targets) and then capture the final expression value.

Also fixed: .bss-prefixed sections (like .bss..brk) now emit @nobits instead of @progbits.

Files modified:
  - src/ir/lowering/expr.rs: Handle Stmt::Label wrapping expressions in lower_stmt_expr
  - src/backend/common.rs: Emit @nobits for .bss-prefixed sections

Test: tests/stmt-expr-goto-label/main.c

Kernel bisect: lib/find_bit.c now passes (was failing due to FIND_NEXT_BIT macro miscompilation).
