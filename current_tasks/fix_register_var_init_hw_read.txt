Fix local register variable reads for initialized variables

Status: in_progress

Problem:
Commit 3c5ad0a made ALL local register variable reads go through
read_global_register(), which reads the hardware register. But for
variables like `register long x8 __asm__("x8") = n;` (with an initializer),
the intent is NOT to read the hardware register. The initializer stores
to the alloca but the read bypasses it and reads the hw register instead.

This causes ARM musl to hang because __syscall1() uses:
  register long x8 __asm__("x8") = n;  // syscall number
  register long x0 __asm__("x0") = a;  // arg
Both get their values from the hw register (uninitialized junk) rather
than from the initializer values.

Fix:
Track whether a local register variable has an initializer. If it does,
read from the alloca (normal path). Only read the hardware register for
uninitialized register variables (like `register unsigned long tp __asm__("tp");`).
