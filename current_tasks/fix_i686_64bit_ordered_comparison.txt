Fix i686 64-bit ordered comparison (signed)

The emit_i128_cmp_ordered function in the i686 backend has a bug where
signed 64-bit comparisons (Slt, Sle, Sgt, Sge) use signed setCC instructions
for both the high word and low word comparisons.

When the high 32-bit words are equal, the low 32-bit words must be compared
as UNSIGNED (since they represent the magnitude within the same sign).
Currently, the code uses the same signed setCC for both cases, which produces
wrong results when the low words cross the 0x80000000 boundary.

Fix: Use a two-path approach where:
- If high words differ: use signed comparison flags
- If high words equal: use unsigned comparison flags for low words

Status: in_progress
