Task: Implement =@cc condition code output constraints for inline assembly

The Linux kernel extensively uses GCC's =@cc<condition> inline asm constraint
syntax for atomic operations. Currently our compiler either:
1. Silently miscompiles =@cce / =@ccne etc. by treating them as regular GP register
   outputs (wrong value stored - no SETcc instruction emitted)
2. Fails to parse the constraint when split across string literals ("=@cc" "e")

This causes nearly all kernel files to fail to compile because atomic.h uses this
pattern pervasively.

Fix: Add proper =@cc handling:
- AsmOperandKind::ConditionCode(condition_suffix) variant
- classify_constraint detects @cc prefix in all backends
- Phase 4 emits SETcc + movzbl instead of regular register store
- Map condition suffixes to x86 SET instructions (e, ne, s, ns, o, no, etc.)

Status: in progress
