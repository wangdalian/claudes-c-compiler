Fix ARM inline asm "Q" memory constraint for AArch64

Problem: musl uses "Q" memory constraint in inline assembly for atomic operations
(ldaxr/stlxr). On AArch64, "Q" means "a memory address which uses a single base
register" and should produce [Xn] syntax. Our compiler doesn't recognize "Q" as a
memory constraint, so it falls through to GpReg, producing bare register names
without brackets.

Error: ldaxr w9,x10 (should be ldaxr w9,[x10])

Fix:
1. Add "Q" to ARM classify_constraint as Memory
2. Update ARM substitute_template_line to format memory operands with [reg] syntax
3. Ensure Q constraint operand gets address loaded into a register properly

This blocks musl on ARM (affects sigaction, siglongjmp, sigqueue, etc).
