Fix: preprocessor -E mode should output preprocessed text even when #error directives are encountered.
Currently, #error causes the -E output to be empty, breaking configure scripts (e.g., privoxy)
that grep the preprocessed output ignoring the exit code. GCC outputs the full preprocessed text
and exits non-zero; we should match this behavior.
