Move TypeContext and FunctionTypedefInfo from ir/lowering to common/

Problem: TypeContext is defined in ir/lowering/type_context.rs but is created and
populated by sema, then transferred to the lowerer. This creates a backwards
dependency: sema imports from ir::lowering. FunctionTypedefInfo is similarly
defined in ir/lowering/definitions.rs but used by sema.

This architectural issue means:
- sema depends on ir/lowering types (wrong dependency direction)
- TypeContext is conceptually shared infrastructure, not lowering-specific
- Moving more functionality into sema requires importing more from lowering

Plan:
1. Move TypeContext to common/type_context.rs
2. Move FunctionTypedefInfo to common/type_context.rs (it's used by both)
3. Move extract_fptr_typedef_info helper to common/type_context.rs
4. Update all imports across sema and lowering
5. Re-export from ir/lowering/type_context.rs for backward compat if needed
6. Verify with full build and CI tests

Files affected:
- src/ir/lowering/type_context.rs (source, becomes thin re-export)
- src/ir/lowering/definitions.rs (remove FunctionTypedefInfo)
- src/common/mod.rs (add type_context module)
- src/common/type_context.rs (new, target of move)
- src/frontend/sema/sema.rs (update imports)
- src/ir/lowering/mod.rs (update exports)
- src/ir/lowering/*.rs (update imports as needed)
