Fix x86 peephole store forwarding bug with bswap instructions

Bug: The peephole optimizer's global_store_forwarding pass incorrectly
eliminates loads after bswapl/bswapq instructions.

Root cause: parse_dest_reg_fast() does not recognize bswapl/bswapq as
single-operand instructions that modify their operand register. This
causes the store-forwarding pass to retain stale slot->register mappings
across bswap instructions, leading to incorrect load elimination.

Fix: Add bswapl/bswapq to the single-operand modifier pattern in
parse_dest_reg_fast().

Impact: Fixes mbedtls ARIA-ECB-128 test (making mbedtls 7/7 pass).
Also fixes any code using __builtin_bswap32/64 in expressions where
the bswap result is used inline rather than stored to a named variable.
