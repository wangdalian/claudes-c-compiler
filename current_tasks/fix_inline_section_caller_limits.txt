Task: Fix inlining limits for static inline functions called from section-attributed callers
Status: in_progress

Problem:
When a function has __attribute__((section(".head.text"))) (or similar), it runs in a
special context where cross-section calls may not work. For example, __startup_64 runs
from .head.text during early boot before virtual memory is set up. It calls
check_la57_support (a static inline function) but CCC doesn't inline it because
MAX_INLINE_BLOCKS = 1 is too restrictive for functions with any control flow.
This causes the compiled kernel to crash on boot.

Fix:
1. When the caller has a custom section attribute, use relaxed (always_inline-level) limits
   for inlining static inline callees, since cross-section calls are dangerous.
2. Also increase the general MAX_INLINE_BLOCKS from 1 to 6 to better match GCC behavior
   for static inline functions.
