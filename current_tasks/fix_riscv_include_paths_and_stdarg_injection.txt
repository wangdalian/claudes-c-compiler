Task: Fix RISC-V missing GCC 13 include path and add stdarg.h header injection

Problem:
- RISC-V backend set_target() is missing /usr/lib/gcc-cross/riscv64-linux-gnu/13/include
  in its system_include_paths list (only has versions 11 and 12)
- This means #include <stdarg.h> silently fails on RISC-V, causing va_start/va_arg/va_end
  to be treated as function calls instead of builtins
- Results in 100% failure rate for all stdarg/va_list tests on RISC-V

Fix:
1. Add GCC 13 include path to RISC-V set_target()
2. Add stdarg.h header injection (define va_start/va_arg/va_end/va_copy macros)
   so the compiler works even without system headers
3. Add regression test
