Task: Fix RISC-V inline asm "f" constraint using wrong FP instruction width
Status: in_progress

Bug: The RISC-V backend's inline assembly emitter used constraint-string-based
logic to choose between fmv.w.x (32-bit float) and fmv.d.x (64-bit double)
when loading FP constants. Since the "f" constraint is used for both float and
double, all FP constants were loaded with fmv.w.x, truncating 64-bit doubles
to 32 bits and producing NaN results.

Same issue affected:
- load_input_to_reg (Const path): fmv.w.x vs fmv.d.x
- load_input_to_reg (Value path): fld vs flw
- preload_readwrite_output: fld vs flw
- store_output_from_reg: fsd vs fsw

Fix: Use operand_type (IrType::F32 vs F64) to select the correct instruction
width in all four code paths.
