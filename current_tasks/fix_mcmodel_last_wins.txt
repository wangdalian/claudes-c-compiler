Task: Fix -mcmodel flag last-wins semantics for vDSO compilation

Problem: When both -mcmodel=kernel and -mcmodel=small are passed on the command line,
CCC uses the kernel code model because -mcmodel=small falls through to the catch-all
-m* handler and is ignored. GCC uses last-wins semantics, so -mcmodel=small should
override the earlier -mcmodel=kernel.

This causes the Linux vDSO (arch/x86/entry/vdso/vclock_gettime.c) to fail at link time
because the kernel build system passes -mcmodel=kernel (from the general kernel CFLAGS)
followed by -mcmodel=small (vDSO-specific flags). With the kernel model, the compiler
emits R_X86_64_32S (absolute 32-bit) relocations, but the vDSO is linked as a shared
object which requires PIC-compatible R_X86_64_PC32 relocations.

Fix: Add explicit handling for -mcmodel=small and other non-kernel code models to set
code_model_kernel = false, implementing proper last-wins semantics.

Status: in_progress
