Fix switch unsigned case range comparisons and __builtin_expect side effects

Problem 1: Switch case ranges with unsigned types use signed comparisons
- The emit_switch_dispatch function uses IrCmpOp::Sge/Sle for case ranges
- This fails for unsigned types (e.g., unsigned long long) when case values
  exceed signed max (0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF)
- Test: gcc_torture_pr34154 - case 1000000000000000000ULL ... 9999999999999999999ULL
- The high value 9999999999999999999ULL (0x8ac7...) becomes negative as i64,
  causing the signed comparison to fail

Problem 2: __builtin_expect drops the second argument entirely
- Defined as preprocessor macro: (exp, c) -> (exp)
- This drops side effects of the second argument (e.g., z++)
- Test: gcc_torture_pr85156 - __builtin_expect(x ? y != 0 : 0, z++)
- z++ never executes, causing wrong return value

Fix plan:
1. Pass switch expr_type through to emit_switch_dispatch
2. Use unsigned comparisons (Uge/Ule) when switch type is unsigned
3. Fix the constant folding path for unsigned ranges
4. Remove __builtin_expect from preprocessor macros
5. Handle __builtin_expect as a real builtin in the IR lowering
