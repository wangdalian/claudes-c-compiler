Task: Fix miscompilation of kernel/pid.c causing kernel boot failure

Problem: kernel/pid.c is miscompiled by ccc, causing the kernel to fail to boot.
This file handles PID allocation and management which is critical for kernel operation.
The bisect tool reliably identifies this file as the cause of boot failure.

Plan:
1. Compare ccc output with GCC output for pid.c to find differences
2. Isolate the specific function/construct causing the miscompilation
3. Create a minimal test case reproducing the bug
4. Fix the compiler bug
5. Verify the fix with the bisect tool

Status: in_progress
