Task: Implement #pragma GCC visibility push/pop

Problem: The kernel's EFI stub code includes hidden.h which uses
  #pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)
to mark all symbols as hidden visibility. Our compiler ignores this
pragma, so with -fPIC, symbols get DEFAULT visibility and generate
GOT/PLT-based accesses. In the EFI stub context there's no dynamic
loader, so GOT entries contain garbage -> boot failure.

Fix:
1. Parse #pragma GCC visibility push(hidden|default|protected|internal) / pop
   in the preprocessor, injecting synthetic tokens for the parser
2. Parser tracks a default visibility stack, applies it to all declarations
   that don't have an explicit __attribute__((visibility(...)))
3. Backend: hidden visibility symbols treated as local for GOT/PLT decisions

Status: in_progress
