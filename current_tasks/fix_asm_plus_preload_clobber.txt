Fix inline asm "+" constraint preload clobbering input register value

Bug: In the shared inline_asm.rs backend, the preload_readwrite_output() call at
Phase 2 (lines 618-629) loads from the output pointer into the same register that
was already correctly loaded by the synthetic "+" input's load_input_to_reg() call.

After commit 9c5dc14 (which created temporary allocas for register outputs to enable
mem2reg promotion), the output pointer for non-memory outputs is now an uninitialized
temp alloca. The preload overwrites the register with garbage, causing:
- x86 kernel boot triple fault (native_write_cr4 writes garbage to CR4)
- musl libc_start_main crash (stage2 function pointer clobbered)
- ~392 inline asm test failures
- libsodium sign/box crypto failures
- mbedtls ECP failures

Fix: Remove the preload_readwrite_output block entirely, since the synthetic "+"
inputs (created during IR lowering) already handle loading the correct current value
into the register via load_input_to_reg(). The preload was always redundant (before
the RISC-V fix it loaded the same value; after the fix it loads garbage).
