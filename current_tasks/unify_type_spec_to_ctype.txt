Unify type_spec_to_ctype dispatch between sema and lowering

Problem: The core type_spec_to_ctype() match dispatch is duplicated between
sema.rs (~150 lines) and lowering/types.rs (~90 lines). The 22 primitive-type
arms are pure boilerplate duplication. Only 4 arms differ: TypedefName,
Struct/Union, Enum, and Typeof.

Plan:
1. Add trait methods to TypeConvertContext for the 4 divergent cases
2. Move the shared match dispatch into a default method on TypeConvertContext
3. Each side implements only the divergent trait methods
4. Delete the duplicated type_spec_to_ctype methods
