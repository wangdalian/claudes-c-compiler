Fix i686 linker: don't emit GLOB_DAT for locally-defined GOT symbols

The i686 linker incorrectly places locally-defined symbols (from static libraries)
into .dynsym with GLOB_DAT relocations when they're accessed via R_386_GOT32X.
This causes runtime symbol lookup failures (e.g. aegis128l_soft_implementation in libsodium).

The fix separates GOT symbols into dynamic (need .dynsym + GLOB_DAT) and local
(just need GOT entry filled at link time).
