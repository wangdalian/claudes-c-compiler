Task: Pre-parse assembly lines in peephole optimizer for faster pattern matching

Problem:
Profiling shows the x86 peephole optimizer is the #1 hotspot (~12.7% of total
compile time for SQLite). Each peephole pass re-parses every assembly line with
string operations (strip_prefix, split_once, contains, starts_with) on every
pass. With up to 10 passes and 10 pattern functions, this means each line gets
string-parsed ~100 times.

Solution:
Pre-classify every assembly line into a compact enum once at the start. Store
structured data (register indices, offsets as integers, instruction kind) so
that pattern matching can use integer comparisons instead of string parsing.
This eliminates repeated string scanning across all passes.

Expected speedup: 5-10% on SQLite compilation.

Status: in progress
