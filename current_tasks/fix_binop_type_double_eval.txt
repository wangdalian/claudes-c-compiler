Fix double evaluation in infer_binop_ctype for Add/Sub operations

Problem: In type_checker.rs, infer_binop_ctype() for Add/Sub operations evaluates
infer_expr_ctype(lhs) twice: once in the pointer arithmetic check (line 265),
and again in the general arithmetic conversion fallthrough (line 304). Same for rhs.
This causes O(2^N) behavior on deeply nested binary expression chains.

Fix: Evaluate both lhs and rhs types once at the start of infer_binop_ctype, and
reuse the results for both the pointer arithmetic check and the arithmetic conversion.

This is a complementary fix to the const_eval fix - this one fixes the type checker
which is a root cause affecting all callers, not just enum const evaluation.

Impact: Fixes jq build timeout (compile-time hang on opcode enum with 43 +1 terms).
