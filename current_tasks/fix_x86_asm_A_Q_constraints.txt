Fix x86-64 inline asm "A" and "Q" constraints

Problem 1 - "A" constraint unimplemented on x86-64:
  The GCC "A" constraint maps to rax on x86-64 (or edx:eax on 32-bit).
  Currently classify_constraint ignores 'A', so it falls through to generic
  GpReg, causing the wrong register to be used.
  Affects: asm-constraint-A-x86-002, asm-edxeax-pair-x86-001

Problem 2 - "Q" constraint not restricted to legacy registers:
  The "Q" constraint means "register with accessible high-byte form"
  (only rax, rbx, rcx, rdx). Currently treated as generic GpReg, so
  rsi/rdi/r8+ may be allocated, and %h modifier returns wrong byte.
  Affects: asm-movzx-x86-001b, asm-movzx-x86-001c

Fix: Add 'A' => Specific("rax") and restrict 'Q' scratch allocation
to the four legacy registers (rax, rbx, rcx, rdx) that have high-byte
register forms.

Status: in_progress
