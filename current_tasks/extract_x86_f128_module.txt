Task: Extract x86 F128/x87 handling into a separate module

The x86 codegen.rs (5146 lines, largest in codebase) has ~550 lines of
F128/x87-specific code scattered across multiple functions, with significant
internal duplication (emit_store vs emit_store_with_const_offset F128 paths
are near-identical ~230 lines).

Plan:
1. Extract F128/x87 helpers into f128.rs submodule
2. Deduplicate the SlotAddr-dispatch patterns for F128 store/load
3. Reduce codegen.rs by ~400-550 lines
4. Verify tests pass
