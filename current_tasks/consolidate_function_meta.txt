Consolidate FunctionMeta parallel HashMaps into HashMap<String, FuncSig>

Replace the 10 parallel HashMaps in FunctionMeta with a single HashMap<String, FuncSig>
and a second map for function-pointer signatures. Pure refactor, zero semantic change.

Then extract FunctionBuildState from Lowerer to make function-vs-module state boundary explicit.
