Sema Expression Type Annotations (Step 3 of typed AST plan)

Goal: Have sema annotate expressions with CTypes during its AST walk,
then have the lowerer consume these annotations as a fallback in
get_expr_ctype(), reducing the lowerer's type-inference burden.

Changes:
1. Add an ExprTypeMap (HashMap<ExprNodeId, CType>) to SemaResult
2. Use pointer-based expression identity (raw pointer as key) for ExprNodeId
3. During sema's analyze_expr(), call ExprTypeChecker::infer_expr_ctype()
   and store results in the map
4. Pass ExprTypeMap to lowerer, which consults it as fallback in get_expr_ctype()
5. This is Step 3 from ideas/high_sema_expansion_typed_ast.txt

Status: in progress
