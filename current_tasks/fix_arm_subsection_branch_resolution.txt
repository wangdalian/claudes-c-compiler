Fix ARM assembler: branches in .subsection not resolved after merge

Status: done

Problem:
When ARM assembly code uses .subsection 1 (e.g. for kernel alternative instructions),
branches within the subsection that target labels in the main section (.subsection 0)
are stored in pending_branch_relocs with the subsection name (e.g. ".text.__subsection.1").

After merge_subsections() merges the subsection data into the parent section and removes
the subsection from the sections map, resolve_local_branches() cannot find the section
data for these pending relocs (sections.get_mut returns None), so the branch instruction
is silently left as 0x14000000 (branch-to-self = infinite loop).

This causes the ARM standalone tinyconfig kernel to build successfully but hang at boot.

Root cause:
- pending_branch_relocs entries record section as self.base.current_section at emit time
- When in .subsection 1, this is ".text.__subsection.1"
- merge_subsections() updates labels and regular relocs but NOT pending_branch_relocs
- resolve_local_branches() silently skips entries whose section no longer exists

Fix:
After calling merge_subsections(), update pending_branch_relocs entries whose section
was a subsection: change the section name to the parent and adjust the offset by
the parent's original length (same as is done for labels and regular relocs).
