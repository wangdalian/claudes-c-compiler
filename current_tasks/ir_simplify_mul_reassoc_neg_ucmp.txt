IR Simplify Pass: Multiply Reassociation, Neg Conversion, and Unsigned Cmp Simplification
========================================================================================
Status: in_progress

Adding several missing algebraic simplifications to the IR simplify pass:

1. Multiply reassociation: (x * C1) * C2 => x * (C1 * C2)
   - Reduces two multiply instructions to one
   - Common in array indexing and struct offset calculations

2. Multiply by -1 => UnaryOp::Neg
   - x * (-1) => neg(x) produces a single neg instruction instead of imul
   - Common in negation expressions

3. Subtract of negation => addition
   - x - (neg y) => x + y  (when rhs is defined by UnaryOp::Neg)
   - Eliminates an unnecessary negation

4. Unsigned comparison simplifications
   - Cmp(Ule, x, 0) => Cmp(Eq, x, 0)   (unsigned x <= 0 is same as x == 0)
   - Cmp(Ugt, x, 0) => Cmp(Ne, x, 0)   (unsigned x > 0 is same as x != 0)
