Task: Fix _Complex long double stack argument passing ABI bug
Owner: agent
Status: in-progress
Description: struct_arg_sizes vector was not updated when decompose_complex_call_args
expanded complex arguments into (real, imag) pairs, causing index misalignment
that made the backend dereference a float value as a memory pointer (segfault).
