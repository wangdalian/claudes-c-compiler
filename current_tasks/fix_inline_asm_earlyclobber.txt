Fix inline asm register allocation for early-clobber and "+" read-write constraints.

Problem: When inline asm has many operands with "+&r" (read-write, early-clobber) constraints,
the synthetic inputs created for "+" outputs consumed scratch registers instead of being tied
to their outputs. This exhausted all available GP registers, causing the allocator to fall back
to already-used registers (e.g., rcx), resulting in register collisions and segfaults.

Also implements proper early-clobber (&) semantics: input-only operands are excluded from
registers used by early-clobber output operands.

Reproducer: xz/liblzma LZMA decoder with x86-64 inline asm (LZMA_RANGE_DECODER_CONFIG=0x080).
