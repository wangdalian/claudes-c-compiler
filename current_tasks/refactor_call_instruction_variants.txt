Refactor: Extract CallInfo struct from Call/CallIndirect instruction variants

The Instruction::Call and Instruction::CallIndirect enum variants each have 11
fields, sharing 10 of them. This causes:
- Duplicated match arms across 21+ files (38 Call + 25 CallIndirect = 63 sites)
- 10+ places with near-identical code for both variants
- Difficult to add new call-related fields (must update every match site)

Plan:
1. Create a CallInfo struct with the 10 shared fields
2. Refactor Call to { info: CallInfo, func: String }
3. Refactor CallIndirect to { info: CallInfo, func_ptr: Operand }
4. Update all 21 files to use the new structure
5. Merge duplicate match arms where possible

This is a purely mechanical refactoring with zero functional changes.
