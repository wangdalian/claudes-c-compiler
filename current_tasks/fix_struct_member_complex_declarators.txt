Fix struct member parsing to use general declarator parser

Problem: Struct/union field declarations with complex declarators like function
pointers returning function pointers (e.g. `void (*(*xDlSym)(void*,const char*))(void)`)
fail to parse. The struct field parser uses a hand-written single-level function
pointer recognizer instead of the general recursive parse_declarator().

This breaks sqlite3 (sqlite3_vfs struct), jq, and other real-world projects.

Fix: Add `derived: Vec<DerivedDeclarator>` to StructFieldDecl, use parse_declarator()
for struct member declarators, update downstream code (sema, lowering) to apply
derived declarators when computing struct field types.

Status: In progress
