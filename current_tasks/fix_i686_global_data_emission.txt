Task: Fix i686 global data emission for 64-bit and 128-bit types
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-28

Description:
On i686, the global data emission code in backend/common.rs uses PtrDirective::Long
(.long = 4 bytes) for all data sizes. This truncates 64-bit values:

1. IrConst::F64: emits `.long <64-bit-value>` which truncates to 32 bits.
   All global doubles read as 0 or corrupt values.
2. emit_int_data for I64/U64: same truncation issue for 64-bit integers.
3. IrConst::I128: emits two `.long` (8 bytes) instead of four (16 bytes).
4. IrConst::LongDouble x86 path: the `lo` u64 also gets truncated.

Fix: When ptr_dir.is_32bit(), split 64-bit values into two .long directives
(low 32 bits first, then high 32 bits) for little-endian correctness.
Split 128-bit values into four .long directives.
