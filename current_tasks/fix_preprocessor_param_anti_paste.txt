Task: Fix preprocessor macro parameter substitution to use anti-paste guards

Problem: When macro parameters are substituted with their arguments during
expansion, the resulting text could accidentally create multi-character tokens
by merging the end of preceding text with the start of the argument. For example,
#define ADJUST(arr, top, i) arr[top-i+1] expanded with i=-1 would produce
arr[top--1+1] instead of arr[top- -1+1], causing the lexer to parse top--
(post-decrement) instead of top - -1 (subtract negative one).

This bug caused Chibi-Scheme compilation to fail on all architectures.

Fix: Changed substitute_params() in macro_defs.rs to use append_with_paste_guard()
instead of raw push_str() when inserting macro argument text, for all three
substitution paths (regular params, __VA_ARGS__, and named variadic params).

Also added __builtin_nextafter/nextafterf/nextafterl as libc aliases (needed
for JerryScript compilation).

Test results:
- x86: 2990/2990 (100.0%) tests, all projects PASS
- ARM: 2850/2868 (99.4%) tests, all projects PASS
- RISC-V: 2848/2859 (99.6%) tests, 11/12 projects PASS (mbedtls pre-existing)
- i686: 2734/2737 (99.9%) tests, 11/12 projects PASS (mbedtls pre-existing)

Status: in_progress
