Dedup inline assembly codegen across x86, ARM, and RISC-V backends.

All three backends have nearly identical inline asm handling (~590 lines total) that follows
the same 4-phase structure: assign registers to operands, resolve tied/read-write operands,
load inputs and emit template with substitution, store outputs back.

Plan:
- Extract a shared generic inline asm framework in codegen_shared.rs
- Each backend provides: scratch register pools, constraint-to-register mapping, operand
  substitution format
- The shared framework handles: register assignment, tied operand resolution, +constraint
  handling, GCC operand numbering, template line splitting
- Expected savings: ~300 lines of duplicated code
