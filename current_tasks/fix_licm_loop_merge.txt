Fix LICM: merge natural loops with same header to prevent incorrect hoisting

Root cause: find_natural_loops() creates separate NaturalLoop entries for each
back edge targeting the same header. When a loop has multiple back edges (e.g.,
"continue" in a while-loop plus "break" from switch cases that loop back),
each back edge produces a loop body that is a SUBSET of the full loop.

LICM then processes each subset independently. A small subset may lack stores
or calls that exist in the full loop, causing LICM to incorrectly determine
that a load is safe to hoist. For example, in TCC's tcc_parse_args(), the
while(optind < argc) loop has many back edges. A subset with only 5 blocks
has no calls and no stores to the argc alloca, so LICM hoists the argc load
to the preheader. But the full loop modifies argc through &argc passed to a
called function. This causes an infinite loop at runtime.

Fix: After collecting all natural loops, merge loops that share the same
header block by taking the union of their body sets. This ensures LICM
analyzes the complete loop body for memory effects.
