Fix ARM64 codegen bug: emit_store_stack_params clobbers x0 register argument.

When a function has 9+ parameters, the callee prologue loads stack-passed arguments
into x0 as scratch, destroying any GP register arguments (x0-x7) that haven't been
spilled yet (e.g., because mem2reg promoted their allocas).

Fix: Use x9 as scratch register in emit_store_stack_params, matching the existing
fix in emit_store_fp_params_simple.

Affects: picohttpparser on ARM, and any function with 9+ args where early params
are mem2reg-promoted.
