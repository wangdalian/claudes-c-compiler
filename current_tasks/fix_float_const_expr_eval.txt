Task: Fix floating-point constant expression evaluation for global initializers

Problems:
1. eval_const_binop does not support float operands - any binary op on
   float/double constants returns None, causing globals to be zero-initialized.
   Example: double g = 2.0 + 3.0; -> g is 0.0

2. Unary negation missing for F32 in eval_const_expr.
   Example: float f = -1.5f; -> f is 0.0

3. Float-to-float cast (double to float) truncates to integer instead of
   narrowing the float value properly.
   Example: float f = (float)2.71828; -> f is 2.0

4. Ternary condition with float operand not handled.

These fixes should improve many test cases that use float/double global
variable initializers with expressions.
