Task: Extend GEP base liveness for safe indirect GEP folding into load/store addressing
Status: done
Agent: runtime_perf
Started: 2026-01-27

Goal: Improve runtime performance of compiled code by folding GEP (GetElementPtr)
offset computations into load/store addressing modes for non-alloca pointer bases.
Previously, GEP folding only worked for alloca-based pointers. This extends it to
struct/array pointers passed as function arguments or loaded from memory, which
requires extending the GEP base value's liveness through the load/store use points
so the register allocator keeps the base in a register.

Key changes:
- src/backend/liveness.rs: New extend_gep_base_liveness() function extends base
  value live intervals through load/store points that use foldable GEPs
- src/backend/generation.rs: Extended GEP fold conditions to allow folding when
  base has a register assignment (not just alloca)
- src/backend/x86/codegen/codegen.rs: Optimized emit_load_with_const_offset and
  emit_store_with_const_offset to use register-offset addressing (e.g., movl 4(%rbx), %eax)
  when the base is in a register

Performance: ~4% runtime improvement on zlib minigzip, ~9% code size reduction in deflate.o
Correctness: verify_compiler.py --ratio 10: 2966/2990 pass (99.2%), all 24 failures pre-existing
