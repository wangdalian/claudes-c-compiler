Implement native x86-64 assembler and ELF linker for --my-asm and --my-link flags.

This replaces the GCC-based assembler and linker with custom implementations:
1. x86-64 instruction encoder that parses AT&T assembly text and emits machine code
2. ELF object file writer that produces .o files with proper sections and relocations
3. Native ELF linker that resolves relocations and links with system libc
4. --my-asm flag to use native assembler instead of gcc
5. --my-link flag to use native linker instead of gcc

Starting with x86-64 backend only. The linker infrastructure will be shared
across backends, with arch-specific relocation handling.
