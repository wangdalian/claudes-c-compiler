Task: Eliminate unnecessary TokenKind::clone() overhead in parser

Profiling shows TokenKind::clone at 2.58% of compile time. The parser uses
peek().clone() pattern ~25 times, cloning entire TokenKind (including owned
String payloads) when most callers only need the variant discriminant.

Fix: Match on &TokenKind from peek() directly, only clone inner Strings
when actually consumed. This eliminates heap allocations for identifier/string
tokens that are only peeked at but not consumed.

Status: in progress
