Implement dead register move elimination in x86 peephole optimizer

The codegen's accumulator model produces many register-to-register moves
where the destination register is never read before being overwritten.
Example from DOOM's R_DrawColumn inner loop:

    movzbq (%rax), %rax     ; load pixel
    movq %rax, %r14          ; dead - %r14 overwritten at loop start
    movzbq %al, %rax         ; also redundant
    movq %rax, %r15          ; dead - %r15 overwritten below

This pass scans forward from each reg-to-reg movq to check if the
destination register is overwritten before being read. If so, the
move is eliminated.
