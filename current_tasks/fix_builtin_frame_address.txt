Fix __builtin_frame_address(0) and __builtin_return_address(0)

Currently both return constant 0 (stub). This causes postgres infinite_recurse
test to crash the server (stack depth check fails because frame address is NULL),
which cascades to fail ~130 subsequent postgres tests.

Plan:
1. Add FrameAddress and ReturnAddress to IntrinsicOp
2. Add corresponding BuiltinIntrinsic variants
3. Lower the builtins to IR intrinsic instructions
4. Implement codegen for all 3 backends (x86: rbp, ARM: x29, RISC-V: s0)
5. Add regression test
