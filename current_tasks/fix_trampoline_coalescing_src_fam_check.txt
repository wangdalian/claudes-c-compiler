Fix peephole trampoline coalescing: add src_fam fall-through safety check

Bug: The eliminate_loop_trampolines peephole pass only checks if dst_fam is read
on the fall-through (exit) path after a conditional branch. It does NOT check
whether src_fam is read on the fall-through path.

After coalescing, the initial copy (movq %dst, %src) is NOPed, leaving src_fam
uninitialized. If the exit path reads src_fam (common in do-while loops where
the updated loop variable is used after the loop), it reads garbage/uninitialized.

Fix: Add src_fam read/write checks to the fall-through safety verification loop.

Affects: mquickjs (all x86 tests crashed with SIGSEGV), likely the Linux kernel
boot failure, and many other do-while loop patterns.

Status: in_progress
