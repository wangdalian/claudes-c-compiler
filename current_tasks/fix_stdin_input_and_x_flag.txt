Fix stdin input reading and -x language flag for kernel build

Problem: The kernel build system's cc-version.sh uses:
  cat <<EOF | "$CC" -E -P -x c - 2>/dev/null
  ...
  EOF
This pipes C source code through stdin using "-" as the filename and
"-x c" to specify the language.

Our compiler fails because:
1. "-" as a filename is treated as an unknown flag (silently ignored)
2. "-x" flag is parsed but its value is discarded (marked TODO)
3. No code reads from stdin anywhere in the driver

Impact: Linux kernel build fails at configuration stage on ALL architectures
with "unknown C compiler" error because cc-version.sh can't probe our compiler.

Fix:
1. Handle "-" as a special filename meaning "read from stdin" in main.rs
2. Implement the -x flag to track the current language setting
3. When reading from stdin, use the -x language to determine file type
4. In driver.rs, detect stdin filenames and read from std::io::stdin()

Status: IN PROGRESS
