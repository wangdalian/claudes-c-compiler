Fix x86 standalone kernel link errors:

1. level1_fixmap_pgt + (N << 12): parse_data_values fails to parse
   complex "symbol + expr - const + const" expressions. The " - " check
   splits on the wrong boundary, leaving "symbol + (expr)" as a symbol name.

2. Undefined reference to '0f': a numeric forward label reference not
   resolved during altinstructions macro expansion.

3. Mangled expression '(((1' in .altinstructions: likely an expression
   fragment from alt_max_2/alt_max_3 macros not being properly evaluated.
