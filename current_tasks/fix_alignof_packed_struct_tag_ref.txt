Task: Fix __alignof__ for packed struct tag references in _Static_assert

Problem: When _Static_assert uses __alignof__(struct packed_struct) where
packed_struct was previously defined with __attribute__((packed)), the parser's
compile-time constant evaluator returns the wrong alignment (ptr_size instead of 1).

This is because the parser's alignof_type_spec() only checks the is_packed flag
on the TypeSpecifier node, but for tag references (struct name without body),
is_packed is always false since the packed attribute was on the original definition.

The kernel x86 defconfig build fails on:
- arch/x86/kernel/signal_32.c: __alignof__(siginfo32_t) == 4
- drivers/platform/x86/wmi.c: __alignof__(struct guid_block) == 1

Fix: Add struct tag alignment tracking to the parser so it can look up
alignment info for previously-defined struct/union tags during constant
expression evaluation.

Status: in_progress
