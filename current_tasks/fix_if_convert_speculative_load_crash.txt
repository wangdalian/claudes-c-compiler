Task: Fix if-conversion speculative load crash (Load treated as side-effect-free)
Status: In Progress

Problem:
The if-conversion pass (passes/if_convert.rs) treats Load instructions as side-effect-free
in is_side_effect_free(). While loads don't have write side effects, they CAN TRAP
(segfault) on invalid pointers. When the pass hoists loads from conditional arms into
unconditional code, it speculatively executes loads that were originally guarded by
null-pointer checks.

This causes crashes in Lua, mquickjs, libpng, libsodium, redis, mbedtls, and postgres.
For example, Lua's enterblock() function has:
  bl->insidetbc = (fs->bl != NULL && fs->bl->insidetbc);
The && gets lowered to a conditional branch diamond, which if-conversion converts to
a Select/cmov. But the right-hand side (fs->bl->insidetbc) dereferences fs->bl even
when it's NULL.

Fix:
1. Remove Instruction::Load from is_side_effect_free()
2. Also remove Instruction::GetElementPtr since it feeds into loads
3. Add regression test
4. Verify multiple projects are restored
