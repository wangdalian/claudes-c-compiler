Fix LICM pass hoisting division/remainder operations out of guarded conditionals.

The LICM (Loop Invariant Code Motion) pass in src/passes/licm.rs treats all BinOp
instructions as safe to hoist, including SDiv/UDiv/SRem/URem which can trap on
divide-by-zero (SIGFPE). When a division is inside a loop body but guarded by a
condition (e.g. `if (x != 0) { result = y / x; }`), and its operands are loop-invariant,
LICM hoists it to the preheader where it executes unconditionally, causing a
divide-by-zero crash.

Discovered via kernel bisect: drivers/pci/probe.c fails to boot because
`available_buses / hotplug_bridges` in pci_scan_child_bus_extend is hoisted
above the `dev->is_hotplug_bridge` guard.

Fix: Add `!op.can_trap()` guard to `is_hoistable()` in licm.rs, matching
the existing guard in if_convert.rs.
