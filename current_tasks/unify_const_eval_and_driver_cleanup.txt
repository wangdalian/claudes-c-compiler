Unify duplicated const_eval infrastructure and clean up driver dead code

Goals:
1. Extract shared const_eval helper functions (eval_const_binop, eval_const_binop_float,
   eval_const_expr_as_bits, eval_offsetof helpers) into a common module so both sema
   and lowering can share a single implementation instead of maintaining near-identical
   copies (~400-500 lines of duplicated logic).

2. Make type_checker's eval_const_expr delegate to SemaConstEval (resolving the explicit
   TODO at type_checker.rs:527).

3. Fix driver dead code:
   - Remove duplicated parse error check at driver.rs:430-432 (dead code, already checked at 421)
   - Check preprocessor errors in the driver (currently silently swallowed)
   - Remove unused sema warnings collection (stored but never read)
   - Remove duplicated implicit declaration warning in lowerer (already emitted by sema)
