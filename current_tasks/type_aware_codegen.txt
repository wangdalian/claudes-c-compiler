Implementing type-aware code generation for all backends.

This involves:
1. Adding a 'ty' field to the Store instruction in IR
2. Updating x86, ARM, and RISC-V codegen to use correct sized mov/load/store
   instructions based on the type (movb/movw/movl/movq for x86, etc.)
3. Updating the lowerer to propagate proper types through IR instructions
   and use correct element sizes for arrays
4. Making alloca sizes match actual types (4 bytes for int, 1 for char, etc.)
