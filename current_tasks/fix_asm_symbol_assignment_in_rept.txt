Fix assembler: handle symbol=expr assignments during macro expansion phase

Problem: The x86 assembler's expand_gas_macros_with_state() only handles
.set symbol, expr for tracking symbol values. The equivalent GAS syntax
"symbol = expr" (e.g., i = 0, i = i + 1) is NOT handled during macro
expansion. This means symbols assigned with = inside .rept bodies are
never resolved, causing unresolved references to symbols like "i".

This breaks the Linux kernel's head_64.S which uses:
  i = 0
  .rept NUM_EXCEPTION_VECTORS
  pushq $i
  i = i + 1
  .endr

And the PMDS macro which uses:
  i = 0
  .rept (COUNT)
  .quad (START) + (i << PMD_SHIFT) + (PERM)
  i = i + 1
  .endr

Fix: Detect "symbol = expr" lines in expand_gas_macros_with_state() and
treat them identically to .set, updating the symbols map.

Also check if ARM and RISC-V assemblers have the same issue.
