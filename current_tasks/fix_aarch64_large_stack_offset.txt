Task: Fix AArch64 immediate offset out of range for large stack frames

Problem:
- emit_store_to_sp and emit_load_from_sp use a fixed threshold of 32760 for all instructions
- AArch64 unsigned immediate offsets are scaled by access size:
  - strb/ldrb: max 4095
  - strh/ldrh: max 8190
  - str w/ldr w/ldrsw: max 16380
  - str x/ldr x: max 32760
- Tests with large stack frames (>16KB) fail when accessing 4-byte values at high offsets

Fix:
- Determine max offset from the instruction type in emit_store_to_sp/emit_load_from_sp
- Also check other places where [sp, #offset] is emitted directly

Affected tests: 11 tests (compiler_suite_0011_0109, 0054_0208, 0104_0968, etc.)
