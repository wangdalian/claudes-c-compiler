Fix union cast expressions and global compound literal address-of patterns.

Bug 1: Union cast expressions like `u = (union convert)x` segfault.
The (union T)expr GCC extension should create a temporary union, store the value
into the first member whose type matches, and return the union. Currently, lower_cast
treats this as a no-op pointer pass-through because unions are represented as Ptr
in IR, causing invalid memory access.

Bug 2: Global initializers using &(struct tag){1, 2} to take the address of
compound literals at file scope may segfault. The create_compound_literal_global
function exists but may not handle all cases (e.g., nested struct pointers with
compound literal members).

Affected tests: compiler_suite_0059_0030, 0059_0032, 0059_0033, 0030_0110,
gcc_torture_20050929_1, and others tagged compound-literal.
