Task: Fix i686 64-bit atomic fetch return value truncation

Problem:
On i686, __atomic_fetch_xor (and other atomic fetch builtins) on long long types
return a truncated 32-bit value instead of the full 64-bit result.

Root cause: get_call_return_type() in expr_types.rs falls through to
target_int_ir_type() = I32 for atomic builtins because they're not in
builtin_return_type(). The assignment then inserts a spurious IntWiden cast
(cltd) from I32 to I64, destroying the upper 32 bits of the atomic result.

Fix: Make get_call_return_type() aware of polymorphic atomic builtins by
deriving their return type from the first argument's pointee type.

Affects: compiler_suite_0055_0578, compiler_suite_0055_0717, and likely
project-level failures in libsodium/mbedtls that use 64-bit atomics.
