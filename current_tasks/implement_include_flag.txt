Task: Implement -include flag support for forced header inclusion

The compiler currently does not handle the GCC -include flag, which pre-includes
a header file before processing the main source file. This flag is used extensively
by the Linux kernel build system:
  -include ./include/linux/compiler-version.h
  -include ./include/linux/kconfig.h
  -include ./include/linux/compiler_types.h

Without this, CONFIG_64BIT (and many other macros) are not defined, causing
atomic64_t and other types to be missing, which causes ~50% of kernel files
to fail compilation.

Plan:
1. Add force_includes field to Driver struct
2. Handle -include flag in main.rs argument parsing
3. In compile_to_assembly and run_preprocess_only, process forced includes
   by prepending #include directives before the main source
4. Add regression test
5. Verify kernel bisect results improve
