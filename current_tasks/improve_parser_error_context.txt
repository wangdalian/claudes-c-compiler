Task: Improve parser error messages with better context and fix-it hints

Goals:
1. Add context strings to bare expect() calls (convert to expect_after where appropriate)
2. Add fix-it hints to expect_closing() for missing closing delimiters
3. Add context to expect() calls for opening delimiters (e.g., "expected '(' after 'if'")
4. Fix silent errors where error_count is incremented without emitting any diagnostic message
