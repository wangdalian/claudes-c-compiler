Improve RISC-V shared library linker: add R_RISCV_GLOB_DAT dynamic relocations
for external GOT symbols, fix hardcoded section index in .dynsym, and add
PT_GNU_RELRO segment to shared library output.

These fixes make the shared library linker more correct and robust for complex
shared libraries that reference external symbols.
