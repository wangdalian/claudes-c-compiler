Fix x86 F128 (long double) load/store through GEP-folded paths

Bug: When storing/loading F128 values through GEP-folded constant offsets
(e.g., the imaginary part of _Complex long double at base+16), the x86
backend incorrectly uses movq instead of x87 fstpt/fldt instructions.

This causes complex long double arithmetic through pointers or struct
members to produce -nan values.

Fix: Override emit_load_with_const_offset and emit_store_with_const_offset
in the x86 backend to handle F128 types with proper x87 instructions.
