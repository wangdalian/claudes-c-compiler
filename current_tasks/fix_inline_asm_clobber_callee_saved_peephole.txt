Task: Fix inline asm callee-saved clobber registers eliminated by peephole pass

Problem: When inline asm declares a callee-saved register (e.g., "ebx") in its clobber list,
the codegen correctly adds it to the function's callee-saved set and emits save/restore in
the prologue/epilogue. However, the peephole pass's `eliminate_unused_callee_saves` scans
function bodies for textual register references to decide if saves can be removed. When the
inline asm template doesn't explicitly mention the clobbered register in the emitted assembly
text, the pass incorrectly removes the save/restore, causing the register to be silently
corrupted. This caused the Linux kernel fs/binfmt_elf.c to crash on boot because __put_user_8
clobbers %rbx via a non-standard calling convention.

Fix: Emit comment annotations (e.g., "# asm clobber %rbx") after inline asm for each
callee-saved register in the clobber list. The peephole pass's line_references_reg check
finds these annotations and preserves the save/restore.

Status: completed
