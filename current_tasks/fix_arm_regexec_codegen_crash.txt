Fix ARM codegen crash in oniguruma regexec.c (jq regex test on ARM)

Problem: jq's regex test crashes on ARM when using character class matching.
The crash is in oniguruma's match_at function in regexec.c.
Works on x86 and RISC-V, ARM-specific codegen bug.

Plan:
1. Reproduce the crash by running jq ARM tests
2. Bisect to isolate which function/code path causes the crash
3. Debug with GDB under qemu-aarch64 to find exact crash location
4. Fix the ARM codegen bug
5. Add regression test
