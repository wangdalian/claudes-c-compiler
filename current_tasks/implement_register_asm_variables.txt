Implement register __asm__("regname") variable support

Bug: `register long r10 __asm__("r10") = val;` is silently ignored.
The __asm__("r10") annotation is parsed but discarded. When such variables
are used as inline asm inputs with "r" constraint, the compiler assigns
an arbitrary scratch register instead of the specific register requested.

This breaks musl's __syscall6 which uses register r10/r8/r9 asm variables,
causing mmap to receive garbage arguments and malloc to return NULL.

Fix plan:
1. Parser: capture __asm__("regname") string from variable declarations
2. AST: add asm_register field to InitDeclarator/Declaration
3. IR Lowering: propagate register name to LocalInfo and inline asm constraints
4. Backend: when an inline asm input has "r" constraint and the operand is a
   register variable, use the specific register instead of scratch allocation

Affected projects: musl (malloc fails), likely TCC and libffi too.
