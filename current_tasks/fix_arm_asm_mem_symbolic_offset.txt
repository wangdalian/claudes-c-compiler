Fix ARM assembler: memory operands with symbolic offset expressions

The ARM assembler fails to parse instructions with memory operands that
have symbolic offset expressions like `#(1b - .Lvector_start1110)`.

Example failing instruction from Linux kernel entry.S:
  prfm  plil1strm, [x30, #(1b - .Lvector_start1110)]

Root cause: parse_memory_operand() calls parse_int_literal() for #expr,
which calls asm_expr::parse_integer_expr(). This only handles pure numeric
expressions, failing on symbol names and numeric label refs (1b, 1f).

Fix: When parse_int_literal fails for a #expr in a memory operand, fall
back to storing it as a MemExpr { base, expr } variant. The expression
gets numeric labels resolved during the resolve_numeric_labels pass, then
the full expression is evaluated in the ELF writer after all labels have
known positions.

This also fixes the `add x30, x30, #(1b - \vector_start + 4)` pattern
in the same tramp_ventry macro.
