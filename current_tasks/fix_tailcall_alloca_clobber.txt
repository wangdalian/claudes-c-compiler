Fix tail call optimization clobbering alloca'd memory.

When a function uses __builtin_alloca (DynAlloca), the alloca'd buffer is
on the stack below rsp. The tail call optimization restores rsp from rbp
before the jmp, which means the tail-called function's stack frame may
overlap with and clobber the alloca'd buffer. This causes non-deterministic
behavior (the callee may or may not overwrite the data before it's used).

Fix: Detect subq %reg, %rsp (the DynAlloca pattern) and disable tail call
optimization for functions containing it, just like we do for lea-of-local.
