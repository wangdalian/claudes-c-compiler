Fix: function pointer call comparison in boolean context produces wrong result

Bug: When a function pointer call's return value is compared (e.g., > 0, < 0)
directly in a boolean context (if, &&, ||, ternary), the comparison result is
inverted/wrong. Assigning the return value to a variable first and then comparing
works correctly.

Example:
    typedef int (*fptr)(int, int);
    fptr compare = my_compare;

    // WRONG: compare(1, 3) returns -1, but this evaluates to 1 (true)
    if (compare(1, 3) > 0) { ... }

    // CORRECT:
    int r = compare(1, 3);
    if (r > 0) { ... }

Root cause: extract_func_ptr_return_ctype (expr_types.rs) returned the FunctionType's
return_type CType without peeling its spurious Pointer wrapper. For typedef
`int (*fptr)(int, int)`, stmt.rs lines 74-83 build FunctionTypedefInfo.return_type
as Pointer(Int) instead of Int (the Pointer derived declarator from (*name) syntax
is misinterpreted as part of the return type). This propagates through
build_function_pointer_ctype_from_typedef into the FunctionType CType.

When get_expr_ctype was called on a function call like `compare(1,3)`, it returned
CType::Pointer(Int). Then expr_is_pointer (pointer_analysis.rs line 155) saw the
Pointer wrapper and returned true, causing lower_binary_op (expr.rs line 237) to
route the comparison through the unsigned pointer comparison path (seta/setb)
instead of the signed arithmetic path (setg/setl).

Fix: Added peel_ctype_ptr_wrapper to strip one Pointer layer from ft.return_type
in extract_func_ptr_return_ctype (Shapes 1, 2, and direct Function).
Also fixed infer_expr_type FunctionCall arm to delegate to get_call_return_type
(made pub(super)) for proper resolution of both direct and indirect calls.

Impact: Causes PostgreSQL initdb to PANIC because qsort_interruptible's insertion
sort produces wrong order, corrupting B-tree indexes during bootstrap.

Files changed:
- src/ir/lowering/expr_types.rs (extract_func_ptr_return_ctype, peel_ctype_ptr_wrapper)
- src/ir/lowering/expr.rs (infer_expr_type FunctionCall arm)
- tests/fptr-call-cmp-signed/ (new regression test)

Status: DONE
