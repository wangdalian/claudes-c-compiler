Task: Fix i686 _Complex long double imaginary part offset

Status: in_progress

Problem:
On i686, long double is 12 bytes (80-bit x87 extended, padded to 12 for alignment).
_Complex long double should be 24 bytes (2x12), with the imaginary part at offset 12.

However, complex_component_size() in ir/lowering/complex.rs hardcodes 16 for
ComplexLongDouble (correct for x86-64 where long double is 16 bytes, wrong for i686
where it's 12 bytes). This causes:
- Imaginary part stored at offset 16 instead of 12 (4 bytes of gap, losing data)
- Wrong values read back for imaginary part
- Affects all complex long double operations: init, return, argument passing

Fix locations:
1. ir/lowering/complex.rs:33 - complex_component_size() returns 16 → should be 12 on 32-bit
2. ir/lowering/lvalue.rs:121 - __imag__ lvalue offset hardcoded 16i64 → should be 12i64 on 32-bit
3. ir/lowering/global_init_bytes.rs:1264 - comp_size hardcoded 16 → should be 12 on 32-bit
