Fix _Alignas(typedef_name) resolution

Problem:
- _Alignas(type) is evaluated at parse time in Parser::alignof_type_spec()
- This method has no access to typedef tables, so TypedefName falls through to hardcoded 8
- This causes incorrect alignment for _Alignas(U) where U is a typedef for a type
  with alignment != 8 (e.g., long double with align 16)
- The test compiler_suite_0057_0008 fails because of this

Fix:
1. Defer _Alignas(type) evaluation: store the TypeSpecifier in the AST and resolve
   alignment during IR lowering when full type info is available
2. Fix parser state pollution in parse_alignas_argument (const/volatile leak)
3. Add regression test
