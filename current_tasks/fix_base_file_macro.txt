Implement __BASE_FILE__ predefined preprocessor macro

Bug: The __BASE_FILE__ macro (a GCC/Clang extension) was not implemented.
It should always expand to the name of the main input source file, unlike
__FILE__ which changes to the current file during #include processing.

This caused kernel files like sound/core/seq/seq_ports.c to fail linking
because __BASE_FILE__ was passed through as an identifier, resulting in
undefined symbol references.

Fix: Define __BASE_FILE__ in set_filename() alongside __FILE__, using the
same filename string. Unlike __FILE__, it is never updated during #include
processing, so it always refers to the base compilation unit.

Status: in_progress
