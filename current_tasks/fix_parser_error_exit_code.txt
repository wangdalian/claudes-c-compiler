Fix parser error propagation to exit code

Problem: The compiler exits with code 0 even when there are parser errors.
This causes autoconf type detection (AC_TYPE_SIZE_T) to fail, because
the "sizeof((type))" negative test is expected to fail compilation but
our compiler reports success despite parse errors.

Root cause: Parser uses eprintln!() for error messages but has no error
counter. The driver (compile_to_assembly) doesn't check for parse errors
since Parser::parse() returns a TranslationUnit unconditionally.

Impact: jq segfaults because oniguruma's configure detects size_t as
"unsigned int" (32-bit) instead of the correct 64-bit type. This causes
memory corruption in all size_t-based pointer arithmetic.

Fix:
1. Add error_count field to Parser struct
2. Increment error_count in expect() on mismatch and in parse_primary_expr on unexpected token
3. Add has_errors() method to Parser
4. In driver's compile_to_assembly, check parser.has_errors() and return Err if so

This will fix jq and any other project that relies on configure type checks.
