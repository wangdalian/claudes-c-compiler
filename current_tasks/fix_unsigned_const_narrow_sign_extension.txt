Fix IrConst U8/U16 sign-extension bug in narrow pass
=====================================================
Status: in_progress
Date: 2026-01-26

Problem:
  IrConst::from_i64(255, U8) stored the value as IrConst::I8(-1). When the
  narrow optimization pass narrowed (unsigned_char & 0xFF) from I64 to U8,
  the constant 0xFF was represented as IrConst::I8(-1). Codegen then
  sign-extended -1 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, emitting "andq $-1" (no-op)
  instead of "andq $255".

  This corrupted PostgreSQL's pglz compression, causing initdb to crash
  with "compressed pglz data is corrupt".

Fix:
  Store U8 and U16 constants as IrConst::I64 with zero-extended values
  (same approach already used for U32). This ensures to_i64() returns
  the correct unsigned value instead of sign-extending.

Files changed:
  - src/ir/ir.rs (IrConst::from_i64)
  - src/passes/narrow.rs (try_narrow_const)
