Task: Migrate backend/common.rs assemble_with_extra to TempFile RAII guard

Status: in_progress

Problem:
backend/common.rs::assemble_with_extra() uses manual temp file creation and
cleanup for .s assembly files, while the codebase already has a TempFile RAII
guard in common/temp_files.rs. The manual pattern:
- Duplicates unique-ID generation logic (own AtomicU64 counter + PID)
- Leaks temp .s files if the assembler command fails (cmd.output() error)
- Checks CCC_KEEP_ASM env var twice (once for path, once for cleanup)

Fix:
1. Replace manual temp file path generation with TempFile::new()
2. Use TempFile::set_keep() for CCC_KEEP_ASM debug mode
3. Handle the special case where CCC_KEEP_ASM puts the .s file next to output
4. Let RAII Drop handle cleanup, even on error paths
