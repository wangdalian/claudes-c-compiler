Fix ARM NEON 128-bit vector inline asm operand loading

Problem: CType::Vector(_, _) maps to IrType::Ptr (8 bytes), causing inline asm
"w" constraint operands to only load 64 bits of a 128-bit vector into NEON registers.
This affects eor/ext/bsl/bic/tbl instructions operating on v*.16b register arrangements.

Fix:
1. In IR lowering for inline asm inputs, detect vector types with "w" constraint
   and pass alloca pointer directly instead of loading (like the "+x" fix)
2. Set operand_type to IrType::I128 for 16-byte vector operands so the backend's
   type_size == 16 check triggers correctly for Q-register loads/stores
3. Also fix output handling to store full 128-bit results
