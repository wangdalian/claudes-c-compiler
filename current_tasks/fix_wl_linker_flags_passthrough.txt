Fix -Wl, linker flags being silently discarded by -W warning flag catch-all

The argument parser in main.rs had -Wl,<flags> matching the -W warning flag
catch-all (line 77) before it could reach the -Wl, handler (line 166), making
the -Wl, handler dead code. All -Wl, flags were silently dropped.

This caused PostgreSQL initdb to fail: the postgres binary was linked without
-Wl,--export-dynamic, so dynamically loaded extensions (.so files) couldn't
resolve symbols like CurrentMemoryContext from the main binary.

Fixes:
1. Added !arg.starts_with("-Wl,") guard to the -W catch-all match arm
2. Re-wrap split -Wl, flags with -Wl, prefix when storing them, since we use
   gcc (not ld) as the linker driver and gcc requires the -Wl, prefix
3. Pass -rdynamic through to linker instead of silently ignoring it
