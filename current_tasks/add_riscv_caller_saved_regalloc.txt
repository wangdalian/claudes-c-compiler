Add caller-saved register allocation (t3, t4, t5) to the RISC-V backend.

The CCC-compiled RISC-V kernel hangs during boot due to stack overflow.
Root cause: without caller-saved registers, all intermediate values spill to
the stack, creating stack frames 2-5x larger than GCC. The Linux kernel has
limited stack space (8-16KB) and this causes stack overflow in deeply nested
call chains during early boot (e.g., pcpu_build_alloc_info -> panic).

Fix: Add t3, t4, t5 as caller-saved registers in the RISC-V regalloc config,
following the same pattern used by x86 (r8-r11) and ARM (x13, x14).
These registers are already used as call staging temporaries but are free
between calls. The regalloc Phase 2 correctly only assigns non-call-spanning
values to caller-saved registers.
