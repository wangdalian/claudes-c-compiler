Task: Remove global #![allow(dead_code)] and fix what it reveals (lowerer decomposition commit 10)

Remove #![allow(dead_code, unused_variables, unused_imports, unreachable_patterns)] from lib.rs.
Fix or delete whatever the compiler flags. After commits 1-9, there will be newly dead code from
the old conversion paths, redundant fields, and unused imports. Let rustc find them.

This is a compiler-guided cleanup - pure deletion and minor fixes.

Status: IN PROGRESS
