Fix x86 builtin linker: copy-relocated symbols must have non-zero st_shndx

The x86 builtin linker emits COPY relocation symbols (like optind, optarg,
stderr, stdout, stdin) in the .dynsym table with st_shndx=0 (SHN_UNDEF).
This causes the dynamic linker to NOT properly redirect references to these
symbols to the binary's BSS copy. As a result, glibc's getopt updates its
own internal optind, but the binary reads from its copy which never changes.

Also fixing: copy reloc size should match the original symbol's size, not be
forced to max(size, 8).

Will fix across all backends (x86, i686, arm, riscv) that have this issue.
Testing with 8cc project on x86.
