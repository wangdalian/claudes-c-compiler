Fix missing scope push/pop in statement expression lowering

Bug: lower_stmt_expr() in expr.rs does not call push_scope()/pop_scope(),
so variables declared inside a GNU statement expression ({ ... }) permanently
modify the parent scope. When nested statement expressions declare the same
variable name (extremely common in kernel macros like READ_ONCE, per-CPU
accessors, container_of), the inner declaration overwrites the outer binding,
producing wrong code after the inner expression completes.

This causes widespread kernel boot failures because nearly every kernel file
uses macros that expand to nested statement expressions with identical internal
variable names (__v, __p, __mptr, etc.).

Fix: Add push_scope()/pop_scope() around the statement expression body in
lower_stmt_expr(), matching the pattern used by lower_compound_stmt().

Status: completed
