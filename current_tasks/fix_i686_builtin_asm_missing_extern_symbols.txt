Fix i686 builtin assembler missing undefined symbols for external references

The i686 assembler has the same bug that was just fixed for x86 in commit b3473c70:
external symbols referenced in relocations (like printf, strlen, malloc, free)
are not added to the ELF symbol table as undefined symbols, causing R_386_PC32
relocations to point to symbol index 0 (null) and resulting in segfaults.

Will mirror the x86 fix pattern for the i686 backend.
Testing with jsmn project.
