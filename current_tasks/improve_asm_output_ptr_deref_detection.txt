Task: Improve inline asm output pointer dereference detection
Status: in_progress
Description: Improve the recent fix for inline asm output through pointer dereference.
The previous fix (908026bb) only checks reg_assigned, which misses cases where the
pointer is not register-allocated. This fix uses non_asm_defined check which correctly
identifies indirect pointer outputs regardless of register allocation status.
