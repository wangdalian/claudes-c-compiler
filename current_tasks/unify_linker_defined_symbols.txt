Unify linker-defined symbol lists across x86, i686, ARM, and RISC-V backends.

Currently each linker defines its own set of linker-defined symbols with different
names and inconsistent values. For example:
- __dso_handle gets BASE_ADDR on ARM but data_vaddr on others
- _DYNAMIC is hardcoded to 0 on ARM but actual address on others
- __preinit_array_start/end are 0 on x86/i686, init_array_start on ARM (bug), actual on RISC-V
- ARM resolves __bss_start/_end inline in reloc.rs rather than in the global symbol table
- Some symbols exist only on some backends (edata, end, __end__, __bss_start__)

The fix extracts common linker-defined symbol logic into a shared helper in elf.rs
that all 4 backends call, ensuring consistent symbol definitions.
