Fix: string literals in static const boolean context

Bug: `static const int x = 0 || "hello" || 0;` evaluates to 0 instead of 1.

String literals are always non-null pointers, so they should be truthy in
boolean expressions. The constant expression evaluator (both sema and lowerer)
was returning None for string literal operands in LogicalOr/LogicalAnd/LogicalNot,
causing the entire expression to fail to fold.

Fix: Add expr_is_always_nonzero() helper that recognizes string literals,
and use it in LogicalOr/LogicalAnd/LogicalNot constant evaluation paths.

This fixes toybox (all 4 architectures) - toybox's NEED_OPTIONS flag was
being computed as 0 due to this bug, disabling all command-line option parsing.

Status: in_progress
