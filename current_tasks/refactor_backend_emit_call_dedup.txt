Refactor backend: deduplicate emit_call and emit_store_params across architectures

Problem:
The three backend codegen files (x86: 2,413 lines, arm: 2,780 lines, riscv: 2,735 lines)
have massive structural duplication. emit_call (~930 duplicated lines) and emit_store_params
(~841 duplicated lines) follow identical multi-phase algorithms across all three architectures
with only register names and instruction mnemonics differing.

Plan:
1. Extract shared emit_call algorithm into backend/call_emit.rs with arch-specific primitives
2. Extract shared emit_store_params algorithm into the same module
3. Add trait methods for arch-specific primitives needed by these shared algorithms
4. Reduce each backend codegen file by ~300-500 lines

Status: IN PROGRESS
