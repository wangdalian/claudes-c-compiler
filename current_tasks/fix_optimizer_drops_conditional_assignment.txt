Fix optimizer bug: conditional assignments like `if (x == 0) x = 1;` are being
dropped by the optimizer. The condition is evaluated but the assignment in the
if-branch is never executed. This causes TCC's section_realloc to infinite loop
when data_allocated is 0.

Root cause is likely in CFG simplification or copy propagation dropping the
conditional store.
