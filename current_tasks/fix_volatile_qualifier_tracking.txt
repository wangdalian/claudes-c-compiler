Task: Track volatile qualifier through the pipeline to prevent mem2reg promotion

Problem:
The compiler parses `volatile` but immediately discards it. This means volatile
local variables are promoted to SSA registers by mem2reg. When setjmp/longjmp is
used, longjmp restores registers to their pre-setjmp state, but volatile locals
should retain their modified values (C11 7.13.2.1).

Failing tests:
- compiler_suite_0095_0038: setjmp/longjmp + volatile long long bitwise ops
- compiler_suite_0049_0003: setjmp/longjmp + volatile long int + goto
- Plus any test that depends on volatile semantics across longjmp

Fix plan:
1. Parser: Track `parsing_volatile` flag (like existing `parsing_const`)
2. AST: Add `is_volatile: bool` to Declaration
3. IR: Add `volatile: bool` to Alloca instruction
4. Lowering: Propagate volatile flag from Declaration to Alloca
5. mem2reg: Skip volatile allocas (never promote to SSA registers)
6. Optimization passes: Respect volatile on loads/stores (don't eliminate/reorder)
