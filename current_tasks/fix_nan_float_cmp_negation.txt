Task: Fix NaN-incorrect float comparison negation in simplify pass
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem: The simplify pass transforms !(a <= b) into (a > b) for floating-point
comparisons. This is incorrect when NaN is involved: !(NaN <= x) should be true
(since NaN <= x is false, and !false = true), but (NaN > x) is also false.

The bug was in simplify_cmp() which applied invert_cmp_op() to the inner
comparison without checking whether the comparison type is floating-point.
For floats, ordered comparison inversion is not valid because NaN makes the
relationship non-total.

Impact: Fixes postgres line geometry NaN test (line_interpt with NaN coefficients),
and potentially other NaN-related correctness issues across all architectures.

Fix: Skip inversion for float ordered comparisons (Slt, Sle, Sgt, Sge) in the
simplify pass. Only Eq<->Ne inversion is safe for floats.

Files changed:
- src/passes/simplify.rs: Guard invert_cmp_op calls with float-ordered check
- tests/nan-float-cmp-negation/: Regression test
