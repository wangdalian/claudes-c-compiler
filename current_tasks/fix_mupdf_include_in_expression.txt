Task: Fix preprocessor #include inside multi-line expression context
Status: in_progress

Problem: When #include appears inside a multi-line expression (e.g., inside function
call arguments spanning multiple lines), the preprocessor outputs the included content
before the pending accumulated tokens, causing parse errors.

Fix: In preprocessor.rs, flush the pending_line to output before emitting included
content when an #include directive is encountered during multi-line accumulation.

This fixes the mupdf project which uses #include inside js_dostring() calls.
