Implement string literal deduplication (-fmerge-constants)

GCC deduplicates identical string literals by default (placing them at
the same address in .rodata). Our compiler currently emits separate copies
for each occurrence, even when the strings are byte-identical.

This causes test failures (e.g., compiler_suite_0011_0092 on RISC-V)
where code uses memcmp on struct fields containing pointers to "identical"
string literals. GCC merges them so the pointers match; ours don't.

Plan:
- In the linker/ELF writer for all backends, deduplicate string literals
  in the .rodata section (or wherever they end up)
- Specifically, when emitting string constants, check if an identical
  string has already been emitted and reuse its address
- This should be done at the IR lowering or codegen level
