Task: Encapsulate Driver struct fields and idiomatic error handling

Status: in_progress

Goal: Fix two related Rust code quality issues:
1. Driver struct has 38 pub fields but only 1 is accessed externally (input_files.is_empty() in main.rs).
   Convert all fields to non-pub and add accessor methods where needed.
2. real_main() uses eprintln! + process::exit() instead of returning Result.
   Convert to proper Result-based error propagation.

No functional changes.
