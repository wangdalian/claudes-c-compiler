Fix struct alignment propagation to local variable allocas.

When a struct has fields with __attribute__((aligned(16))), the struct's natural
alignment is 16. But for non-static local variables, only explicit alignment
attributes on the variable declaration were being propagated to the Alloca
instruction. The struct type's inherent alignment was not considered, causing
misaligned stack slots on i686.

Also fixes the i686 alignment bias for omit-frame-pointer mode. The bias value
of 8 (return addr + saved EBP) is only correct when frame pointer is used.
With frame pointer omission, the correct bias is 12 (= 16 - return_addr_size).
