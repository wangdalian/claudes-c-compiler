Task: Implement peephole optimizers for ARM and RISC-V backends
Status: in_progress

Problem: SQLite tests time out on ARM and RISC-V because the generated code
is 4-6x slower than GCC. The x86 backend has a sophisticated peephole optimizer
that removes redundant instructions from the accumulator-based codegen, but
ARM and RISC-V have no such optimizer.

Plan:
1. Implement ARM peephole optimizer (store/load elimination, dead stores,
   self-move removal, redundant jumps, store forwarding, sxtw elimination)
2. Implement RISC-V peephole optimizer (same patterns adapted for RISC-V syntax)
3. Verify SQLite tests pass on all architectures
4. Add regression tests
