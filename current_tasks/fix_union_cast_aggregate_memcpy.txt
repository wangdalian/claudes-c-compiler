Fix: Union cast from aggregate type uses Store instead of Memcpy

The GCC extension `(union foo)bar` where `bar` is a struct/union value
currently stores only a pointer value into the union temporary rather
than copying the struct data. This causes the union to contain garbage
(uninitialized stack memory or the pointer address).

The fix is in src/ir/lowering/expr.rs in the union cast handler:
- When the source is an aggregate type (struct/union), use Memcpy
  to copy the data from the source to the union temporary.
- When the source is a scalar, keep the existing Store logic.

This fixes the PR684 test in llvm_unittest_2006_01_23_UnionInit.
