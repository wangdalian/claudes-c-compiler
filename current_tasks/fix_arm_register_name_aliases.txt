Task: Fix AArch64 register name aliases (r0-r30 -> x0-x30)
Status: in_progress
Started: 2026-01-27

Problem:
The Linux kernel's arm-smccc.h uses `register unsigned long r0 asm("r0")` syntax.
On AArch64, GCC treats r0-r30 as aliases for x0-x30, but our compiler passes them
through literally, generating invalid assembly like `str r0,[sp,#48]` instead of
`str x0,[sp,#48]`.

This breaks compilation of arch/arm64/kernel/proton-pack.c (and likely other files
using ARM SMCCC inline assembly).

Fix:
Add AArch64 register name normalization in the ARM backend's classify_constraint
to map r0-r30 to x0-x30. Also normalize in format_reg_static for template substitution.
