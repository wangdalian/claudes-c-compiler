Task: Fix RISC-V inline asm register allocation to avoid stack spills between CSR writes

Problem: The register allocator excluded all inline asm operands from register
allocation (regalloc.rs lines 400-411), forcing all inline asm input/output values
to live on the stack. The inline asm emitter always loaded inputs from stack and
stored outputs to stack.

This caused two fatal issues in the RISC-V kernel boot:

1. Stack spills between CSR writes: The kernel's set_satp_mode() function changes
   the SATP register (which controls page tables). CCC generated stack stores
   between consecutive CSR writes, causing faults when the new page table didn't
   map the stack.

2. AMO address operand miscompilation: When "+A" (address) constraint operands
   were register-allocated but had no stack slot (due to copy-alias elimination),
   the address was never loaded into the operand register. This caused amoswap
   instructions to use an uninitialized register as the memory address, resulting
   in NULL pointer dereferences in debug_locks_off() (xchg macro) during early boot.

Fix:
1. Removed the blanket exclusion of InlineAsm operands from register allocation
   in regalloc.rs
2. Updated load_input_to_reg to check reg_assignments for all non-alloca, non-FP
   values (including Address operands for "+A" constraints)
3. Updated preload_readwrite_output to handle the case where get_slot returns None
   but the value is register-allocated (no stack slot due to copy-alias elimination)
4. Updated resolve_memory_operand to check reg_assignments before stack access
5. Updated store_output_from_reg to handle register-allocated pointer values for
   both GP and FP register output operands
6. Made callee_saved_name and reg_assignments accessible from asm_emitter module

Files changed:
- src/backend/regalloc.rs: Removed InlineAsm operand exclusion
- src/backend/riscv/codegen/codegen.rs: Made callee_saved_name and reg_assignments pub(super)
- src/backend/riscv/codegen/asm_emitter.rs: Updated all operand handling methods to
  check reg_assignments before falling back to stack access

Testing:
- All 209 unit tests pass
- All inline asm RISC-V tests pass (amo, address-constraint, output-same-var, etc.)
- RISC-V kernel boots successfully through login prompt with verified custom kernel message
- Regression test added: riscv-inline-asm-regalloc-no-stack-spill-riscv

Status: completed
