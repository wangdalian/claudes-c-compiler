Task: Extend IPCP to propagate constants from non-static functions

Problem:
  The IPCP (Interprocedural Constant Propagation) pass only analyzed static functions
  for constant return values. Non-static functions like intel_pxp_is_enabled() that
  always return a constant (0 when CONFIG_DRM_I915_PXP is disabled) were not analyzed.

  This caused a link error when compiling drivers/gpu/drm/i915/pxp/intel_pxp.c because
  the call to intel_pxp_is_enabled() was not replaced with 0, so the dead code path
  referencing intel_pxp_gsccs_is_ready_for_sessions was preserved, causing an undefined
  reference at link time.

Fix:
  Extended IPCP to analyze all defined (non-declaration) functions, not just static ones.
  Since we're replacing calls to the function (not removing the function itself), this is
  safe for non-static functions. Added an exclusion for weak functions since those can
  be overridden by another TU.

Status: completed
