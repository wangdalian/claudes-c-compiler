Task: Division by Constant Strength Reduction
Completed: 2026-01-27

Summary:
Added a new IR optimization pass (src/passes/div_by_const.rs) that replaces
slow integer division and modulo by constants with fast multiply-and-shift
sequences. This converts div/idiv instructions (20-90 cycles on x86) into
imul+shift sequences (3-5 cycles).

Optimizations implemented:
1. Unsigned division by constant: x /u C => multiply-high by magic number + shift
2. Signed division by power-of-2: x /s 2^k => arithmetic shift with bias correction
3. Signed division by constant: x /s C => multiply-high by magic number + shift + sign fix
4. Unsigned/signed modulo: x % C => x - (x / C) * C

Key design decisions:
- Operates at the IR level, benefiting all three backends (x86, ARM, RISC-V)
- Uses Hacker's Delight magic number algorithms for 32-bit division
- Handles C integer promotion: tracks widening casts and loads to identify
  32-bit values promoted to I64, avoiding incorrect expansion of genuine
  64-bit divisions
- Runs in the optimization pipeline after copy propagation and before narrowing

Performance impact:
- Division-heavy micro-benchmark: 2.2x speedup (1.054s -> 0.473s)
- SQLite speedtest1: 50% reduction in div/idiv instructions (408 -> 202)
- All 36 project regression tests pass across all 3 architectures
- Test suite: 99.2-99.4% pass rate (unchanged)
