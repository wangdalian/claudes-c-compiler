Task: Fix always_inline inlining and dead function elimination
Status: completed

Two related fixes for kernel compilation:

1. Increase MAX_ALWAYS_INLINE_BLOCKS from 200 to 500
   - kernel/locking/mutex.c has __mutex_lock_common marked __always_inline
   - Function generates 215 IR basic blocks (312 instructions)
   - GCC has no block limit for always_inline — it always inlines them
   - Was causing undefined reference to __mutex_lock_common

2. Fix dead function elimination for address-taken always_inline functions
   - kernel/module/tree_lookup.c has static __always_inline functions
     mod_tree_less and mod_tree_comp whose addresses are taken as function
     pointers in a struct initializer
   - Dead function elimination was unconditionally removing all static
     always_inline functions, even when their addresses were referenced
   - Fix: only remove if the function is unreachable per reachability analysis
   - Was causing undefined reference to mod_tree_less and mod_tree_comp
