Task: Inline small static (non-inline) functions to fix linker errors

Problem:
  GCC at -O2 inlines small static functions even without the `inline` keyword.
  Our compiler only inlines functions marked `static inline` or `always_inline`.
  This causes linker errors when a static function references a symbol that doesn't
  exist in the build -- GCC eliminates the reference by inlining, but our compiler
  keeps the function with the undefined reference.

  Specific case: drivers/gpu/drm/i915/pxp/intel_pxp.c has a static function
  pxp_fw_dependencies_completed() that calls intel_pxp_gsccs_is_ready_for_sessions(),
  which is not compiled in this config. GCC inlines the static function, eliminating
  the reference. Our compiler keeps it, causing an "undefined reference" linker error.

Fix:
  Extend the inlining pass to also consider small static (non-inline) functions
  as inlining candidates. Use a conservative threshold (e.g., MAX_STATIC_INLINE_INSTRUCTIONS)
  to only inline functions that are small enough to be beneficial.

Status: completed
