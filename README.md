# CCC - C Compiler Collection

A C compiler written from scratch in Rust, targeting x86-64, AArch64, and RISC-V 64.

## Status

**Basic compilation pipeline functional with SSA.** ~98.5% of tests passing across all architectures (ratio 10 sample, ~2900 tests per arch).

### Working Features
- Preprocessor with `#include` file resolution (system headers, -I paths, include guards, #pragma once)
- Recursive descent parser with typedef tracking (modular: expressions, types, statements, declarations, declarators)
- Type-aware IR lowering and code generation
- **SSA construction via mem2reg** (dominator tree, dominance frontiers, phi insertion, variable renaming)
- Phi elimination for backend codegen (parallel copy lowering)
- Optimization passes (constant folding, DCE, GVN, LICM, algebraic simplification, copy propagation, CFG simplification) operating on SSA form
- x86-64 peephole optimizer (eliminates redundant store/load, push/pop, and jump patterns)
- **Compare-branch fusion**: single-use Cmp+CondBranch patterns emit direct conditional jumps (all backends)
- **Linear scan register allocator** with loop-aware liveness analysis (x86-64 and RISC-V backends)
- Three backend targets with correct ABI handling

### Test Results (ratio 10 sample)
- x86-64: 98.4% passing (2943/2991)
- AArch64: 98.0% passing (2812/2869)
- RISC-V 64: 99.2% passing (2837/2861)

### What Works
- `int main() { return N; }` for any integer N
- `printf()` with string literal arguments (via libc linking)
- Basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- Local variable declarations and assignments
- `if`/`else`, `while`, `for`, `do-while` control flow
- Function calls with arbitrary arguments (including stack-overflow float/double args)
- Comparison operators
- **Type-aware code generation**: correct-sized load/store instructions for all types
  - `char` uses byte operations (movb/strb/sb)
  - `short` uses 16-bit operations (movw/strh/sh)
  - `int` uses 32-bit operations (movl/str w/sw)
  - `long`/pointers use 64-bit operations (movq/str x/sd)
  - Sign extension on loads for smaller types
- Array declarations with correct element sizes (4 bytes for int[], 1 for char[], etc.)
- Array subscript read/write (`arr[i]`, `arr[i] = val`)
- Array initializer lists (`int arr[] = {1, 2, 3}`)
- Pointer dereference assignment (`*p = val`, `val = *p`)
- Address-of operator (`&x`, `&arr[i]`)
- Compound assignment on arrays/pointers (`arr[i] += val`, `*p -= val`)
- Pre/post increment/decrement on arrays/pointers (`arr[i]++`, `++(*p)`)
- Short-circuit evaluation for `&&` and `||`
- Proper `sizeof` for basic types and arrays
- 32-bit arithmetic operations for `int` type (addl/subl/imull/idivl on x86)
- **Switch statements**: proper dispatch via if-else comparison chain
  - Case with break, fallthrough, default
  - Nested switch statements
  - Constant case expressions (integer literals, char literals, arithmetic)
- **Global variables**: declarations with initializers, arrays, zero-initialized (.bss)
  - Global scalar initializers (`int x = 42;`)
  - Global array initializers (`int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`)
  - Global pointer-to-string (`char *msg = "hello";`)
  - Read/write access to globals from any function
  - Constant expression evaluation for initializers

### Recent Work
See `git log` for full history. Key milestones:
- Refactored backend to trait-based architecture (`ArchCodegen`) with shared defaults
- Unified CType-to-IrType conversion to single canonical function
- SSA construction via iterated dominance frontier (mem2reg)
- Full `__atomic_*` and `__sync_*` builtins across all three backends
- Position-independent code (`-fPIC`) for x86-64 shared libraries
- Inline assembly support for x86, ARM, and RISC-V
- Transparent union ABI, `__int128`, `_Complex` arithmetic
- Has compiled Lua, zlib, mbedtls, libpng, jq, SQLite, libjpeg-turbo
- Phi cost limiting in mem2reg prevents stack overflow from phi explosion in large switch/computed-goto functions
- GCC-compatible query flags (-dumpmachine, -dumpversion) for autoconf support
- Assembly file (.S/.s) passthrough to target assembler
- XMM register "x" constraint support for x86 inline assembly
- `__attribute__((alias, weak, visibility))` and top-level `asm()` support (musl libc)
- `register` variable `__asm__("regname")` support for pinning variables to specific registers in inline asm
- Performance: Rc<StructLayout> eliminates deep cloning in lowering (~18% compile speedup on sqlite3.c)
- AArch64 inline asm: `"Q"` memory constraint (single base register, `[Xn]` syntax) and `"w"` FP/SIMD register constraint with `%d`/`%s`/`%q` modifiers (needed for musl atomic ops and math functions)
- libffi fixes: `__builtin___clear_cache` support, tied FP register constraint propagation (RISC-V), alloca+indirect call frame addressing (ARM)
- Fix typedef pointer cast arithmetic: `((TypedefPtr) p) - 1` now correctly scales by pointee size (fixes 132 postgres test failures)
- Stdin input support (`-` filename): read source from stdin, needed by kernel cc-version.sh
- `-x` language flag: specify input language (`-x c`, `-x assembler-with-cpp`, `-x none`)
- `-Wa,` assembler pass-through: forward flags to assembler (needed by kernel as-version.sh)
- `-Wp,-MMD,path` and `-MD`/`-MF` dependency file generation: needed by kernel build system
- Bumped `__GNUC__` from 4.8 to 6.5 (satisfies kernel ≥5.1 minimum, stays <7 for glibc compat)
- Fix enum constants in designated array initializers: `expr_might_be_addr()` now excludes enum identifiers, fixing musl vfprintf's states[][] table

### What's Not Yet Implemented
- Some GNU C extensions in system headers (partial `__attribute__` support)
- Long double: partial support (x86 80-bit semantics not fully covered)
- Full register allocator (linear scan with callee-saved registers on x86 and RISC-V; further optimization possible)
- Native ELF writer (currently shells out to gcc for assembly + linking)
- ARM NEON intrinsics (arm_neon.h) - `__ARM_NEON` not defined to avoid parse failures
- Some edge cases in complex number arithmetic

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
# Produces: target/release/ccc (x86), ccc-arm, ccc-riscv
```

## Usage

```bash
target/release/ccc -o output input.c       # x86-64
target/release/ccc-arm -o output input.c   # AArch64
target/release/ccc-riscv -o output input.c # RISC-V 64

# GCC-compatible flags: -S, -c, -E, -O0..3, -g, -D, -I, -x, -MD, -MF
# Read from stdin: echo 'int main(){}' | ccc -E -x c -
```

### Recent Bug Fixes
- **Pointer-to-array struct member access**: Fixed miscompilation where accessing a struct member (e.g., `->bits`) through a dereferenced pointer-to-array-of-struct produced a 32-bit load instead of returning the field address. This caused kernel boot failures in `arch/x86/kernel/process.c` where the `cpumask_var_t` typedef (`struct cpumask[1]`) is used with the per-CPU `ACCESS_PRIVATE` macro pattern involving `typeof`/inline-asm pointer casts. The fix adds array-of-struct handling in `get_pointed_struct_layout` so the struct layout is correctly resolved for member access after array decay.
