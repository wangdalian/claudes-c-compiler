# CCC -- The Claude C Compiler

A C compiler written entirely from scratch in Rust, targeting x86-64, i686,
AArch64, and RISC-V 64. Zero compiler-specific dependencies -- the frontend,
SSA-based IR, optimizer, code generator, peephole optimizers, assembler,
linker, and DWARF debug info generation are all implemented from scratch.
The compiler produces ELF executables without any external toolchain.

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This produces five binaries in `target/release/`, all compiled from the same
source. The target architecture is selected by the binary name at runtime:

| Binary | Target |
|--------|--------|
| `ccc` | x86-64 (default) |
| `ccc-x86` | x86-64 |
| `ccc-arm` | AArch64 |
| `ccc-riscv` | RISC-V 64 |
| `ccc-i686` | i686 (32-bit x86) |

## Usage

```bash
# Compile and link
ccc -o output input.c                # x86-64
ccc-arm -o output input.c            # AArch64
ccc-riscv -o output input.c          # RISC-V 64
ccc-i686 -o output input.c           # i686

# GCC-compatible flags
ccc -S input.c                       # Emit assembly
ccc -c input.c                       # Compile to object file
ccc -E input.c                       # Preprocess only
ccc -O2 -o output input.c            # Optimize (accepts -O0 through -O3, -Os, -Oz)
ccc -g -o output input.c             # DWARF debug info
ccc -DFOO=1 -Iinclude/ input.c       # Define macros, add include paths
ccc -Werror -Wall input.c            # Warning control
ccc -fPIC -shared -o lib.so lib.c    # Position-independent code
ccc -x c -E -                        # Read from stdin

# Build system integration (reports as GCC 14.2.0 for compatibility)
ccc -dumpmachine     # x86_64-linux-gnu / aarch64-linux-gnu / riscv64-linux-gnu / i686-linux-gnu
ccc -dumpversion     # 14
```

The compiler accepts most GCC flags. Unrecognized flags (e.g., architecture-
specific `-m` flags, unknown `-f` flags) are silently ignored so `ccc` can
serve as a drop-in GCC replacement in build systems.

### Assembler and Linker Modes

By default, the compiler uses its **builtin assembler and linker** for all
four architectures. No external toolchain is required. You can verify this
with `--version`, which shows `Backend: standalone` when using the builtin
tools.

To build with optional GCC fallback support (e.g., for debugging), enable
Cargo features at compile time:

```bash
# Build with GCC assembler and linker fallback
cargo build --release --features gcc_assembler,gcc_linker

# Build with GCC fallback for -m16 boot code only
cargo build --release --features gcc_m16
```

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `gcc_assembler` | Use GCC as the assembler instead of the builtin |
| `gcc_linker` | Use GCC as the linker instead of the builtin |
| `gcc_m16` | Use GCC for `-m16` (16-bit real mode boot code) |

When compiled with GCC fallback features enabled, `--version` shows which
components use GCC (e.g., `Backend: gcc_assembler, gcc_linker`).

## Status

The compiler can build real-world C codebases across all four architectures,
including the Linux kernel. FFmpeg compiles and passes all 7331 FATE checkasm
tests on both x86-64 and AArch64 (ARM), using the fully standalone
assembler and linker.

### Known Limitations

- **Optimization levels**: All levels (`-O0` through `-O3`, `-Os`, `-Oz`) run
  the same optimization pipeline. Separate tiers will be added as the compiler
  matures.
- **Long double**: x86 80-bit extended precision is supported via x87 FPU
  instructions. On ARM/RISC-V, `long double` is IEEE binary128 via compiler-rt
  soft-float libcalls.
- **Complex numbers**: `_Complex` arithmetic has some edge-case failures.
- **GNU extensions**: Partial `__attribute__` support. NEON intrinsics are
  partially implemented (core 128-bit operations work).
- **Atomics**: `_Atomic` is parsed but treated as the underlying type (the
  qualifier is not tracked through the type system).

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CCC_TIME_PHASES` | Print per-phase compilation timing to stderr |
| `CCC_TIME_PASSES` | Print per-pass optimization timing to stderr |
| `CCC_DISABLE_PASSES` | Disable specific optimization passes (comma-separated, or `all`) |
| `CCC_KEEP_ASM` | Preserve intermediate `.s` files next to output |
| `CCC_ASM_DEBUG` | Dump preprocessed assembly to `/tmp/asm_debug_<name>.s` |
