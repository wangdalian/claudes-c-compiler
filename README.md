# CCC - C Compiler Collection

A C compiler written from scratch in Rust, targeting x86-64, AArch64, and RISC-V 64.

## Status

**Basic compilation pipeline functional.** ~68% of x86-64 tests passing.

### Working Features
- Preprocessor with `#include` file resolution (system headers, -I paths, include guards, #pragma once)
- Recursive descent parser with typedef tracking
- Type-aware IR lowering and code generation
- Optimization passes (constant folding, DCE, GVN, algebraic simplification)
- Three backend targets with correct ABI handling

### Test Results (10% sample, ratio 10)
- x86-64: ~70.9% passing (2120/2991)
- AArch64: ~72.8% passing (2088/2869)
- RISC-V 64: ~69.1% passing (1978/2861)

### What Works
- `int main() { return N; }` for any integer N
- `printf()` with string literal arguments (via libc linking)
- Basic arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- Local variable declarations and assignments
- `if`/`else`, `while`, `for`, `do-while` control flow
- Function calls with up to 6/8 arguments
- Comparison operators
- **Type-aware code generation**: correct-sized load/store instructions for all types
  - `char` uses byte operations (movb/strb/sb)
  - `short` uses 16-bit operations (movw/strh/sh)
  - `int` uses 32-bit operations (movl/str w/sw)
  - `long`/pointers use 64-bit operations (movq/str x/sd)
  - Sign extension on loads for smaller types
- Array declarations with correct element sizes (4 bytes for int[], 1 for char[], etc.)
- Array subscript read/write (`arr[i]`, `arr[i] = val`)
- Array initializer lists (`int arr[] = {1, 2, 3}`)
- Pointer dereference assignment (`*p = val`, `val = *p`)
- Address-of operator (`&x`, `&arr[i]`)
- Compound assignment on arrays/pointers (`arr[i] += val`, `*p -= val`)
- Pre/post increment/decrement on arrays/pointers (`arr[i]++`, `++(*p)`)
- Short-circuit evaluation for `&&` and `||`
- Proper `sizeof` for basic types and arrays
- 32-bit arithmetic operations for `int` type (addl/subl/imull/idivl on x86)
- **Switch statements**: proper dispatch via if-else comparison chain
  - Case with break, fallthrough, default
  - Nested switch statements
  - Constant case expressions (integer literals, char literals, arithmetic)
- **Global variables**: declarations with initializers, arrays, zero-initialized (.bss)
  - Global scalar initializers (`int x = 42;`)
  - Global array initializers (`int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`)
  - Global pointer-to-string (`char *msg = "hello";`)
  - Read/write access to globals from any function
  - Constant expression evaluation for initializers

### Recent Additions
- **GCC atomic builtins**: Full implementation of `__atomic_*` (C11-style) and `__sync_*` (legacy)
  builtin families across all three backends. Includes `__atomic_fetch_add/sub/and/or/xor`,
  `__atomic_add/sub/and/or/xor_fetch`, `__atomic_compare_exchange_n`, `__atomic_exchange_n`,
  `__atomic_load_n`, `__atomic_store_n`, `__atomic_thread_fence`, `__sync_fetch_and_add/sub/and/or/xor`,
  `__sync_val_compare_and_swap`, `__sync_bool_compare_and_swap`, `__sync_lock_test_and_set/release`,
  and `__sync_synchronize`. x86 uses `lock` prefix instructions, ARM64 uses ldxr/stxr exclusive
  access, RISC-V uses AMO instructions and lr/sc.
- **Flat struct/array initialization fix**: Fixed struct initialization with flat (non-braced)
  initializer lists when the struct contains array fields. Now correctly consumes multiple
  items from the init list for array fields (e.g., `struct { int a[10]; int b; } x = {1,2,...,10,11}`).
  Also fixed global struct init for the same case.
- **Multi-dimensional array init fix**: Fixed boundary snapping for bare expressions in
  multi-dimensional array initializers. Previously, bare scalar values at multi-dim levels
  were incorrectly snapped to sub-array boundaries, causing values to be placed in wrong positions.
- **va_arg register save area (all architectures)**: Fixed variadic function argument passing
  on all three backends. Variadic functions now save register-passed arguments to a register
  save area so `va_arg` can access them. Previously, variadic args passed in registers were
  inaccessible because `va_start` only pointed to the stack overflow area.
- **CType::Bool and _Bool normalization**: Added `CType::Bool` variant to distinguish `_Bool` from
  `unsigned char` at the type level. Stores to `_Bool` lvalues through pointer dereference,
  array subscript, struct/union member access, compound assignment, and increment/decrement
  now correctly normalize values to 0 or 1.
- **#include file resolution**: Full `#include` support reading actual system headers from
  `/usr/include`, with search path support (-I), include guard recognition, #pragma once,
  block comment stripping (C-style `/* */` comments no longer confuse the preprocessor),
  recursive include processing, and GCC-compatible predefined macros.
- **Static local variables**: `static` locals are emitted as globals with mangled names
  (e.g., `func.varname`), preserving values across function calls. Works with
  scalars, arrays, and initializers. Storage class tracking in parser and AST.
- **Typedef tracking**: parser correctly registers typedef names from `typedef` declarations
  (both top-level and local), enabling cast expressions like `(mytype)expr` with user-defined types
- **Built-in type names**: standard C type names (`size_t`, `int32_t`, `FILE`, etc.) pre-seeded
  for correct parsing without full header inclusion
- **Cast expression lowering**: emits proper IR Cast instructions for type-narrowing casts
- **_Complex type handling**: parses and skips `_Complex`/`__complex__` type modifier
- **Inline asm skipping**: parses and skips `asm`/`__asm__` statements and expressions
- **GCC extension keywords**: `__volatile__`, `__const__`, `__inline__`, `__restrict__`,
  `__signed__`, `__noreturn__` recognized as their standard equivalents

### What's Not Yet Implemented
- Parser support for GNU C extensions in system headers (`__attribute__`, `__asm__` renames)
- Floating point
- Full cast semantics (truncation/sign-extension in some cases)
- Inline assembly (parsed but skipped)
- Native assembler/linker (currently uses gcc)
