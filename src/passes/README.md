# Optimization Passes

SSA-based optimization passes that improve the IR before code generation.

## Available Passes

- **cfg_simplify.rs** - CFG simplification: dead block elimination, jump chain threading, redundant branch simplification, trivial phi simplification (single-entry phi to Copy)
- **constant_fold.rs** - Evaluates constant expressions at compile time for both integers and floats (e.g., `3 + 4` -> `7`, `-0.0 + 0.0` -> `+0.0`)
- **copy_prop.rs** - Copy propagation: replaces uses of copies with original values, follows transitive chains
- **dce.rs** - Dead code elimination: removes instructions whose results are never used
- **gvn.rs** - Dominator-based global value numbering: eliminates redundant BinOp, UnaryOp, Cmp, Cast, and GetElementPtr computations across all dominated blocks
- **licm.rs** - Loop-invariant code motion: hoists loop-invariant computations and safe loads to loop preheaders. Includes load hoisting for non-address-taken alloca-based loads that are not modified within the loop (e.g., function parameter loads). Requires single-entry preheaders for soundness
- **narrow.rs** - Integer narrowing: eliminates widen-operate-narrow patterns from C integer promotion (e.g., `Cast I32->I64, BinOp I64, Cast I64->I32` becomes `BinOp I32`). Also narrows comparisons and BinOps with sub-64-bit Load operands
- **if_convert.rs** - If-conversion: converts simple diamond-shaped branch+phi patterns to Select instructions, enabling cmov/csel emission
- **ipcp.rs** - Interprocedural constant return propagation: identifies static functions that always return the same constant on every path (and have no side effects), then replaces calls with the constant value. Critical for Linux kernel static inline config stubs
- **simplify.rs** - Algebraic simplification: identity removal (`x + 0` -> `x`), strength reduction (`x * 2` -> `x << 1`), boolean simplification, math call optimization (`sqrt`/`fabs` -> hardware intrinsics, `pow(x,2)` -> `x*x`, `pow(x,0.5)` -> `sqrt`). Float-unsafe simplifications (e.g., `x + 0`, `x * 0`, `x - x`) are restricted to integer types to preserve IEEE 754 semantics

## Pass Pipeline

All optimization levels (`-O0` through `-O3`, `-Os`, `-Oz`) run the same full pipeline.
While the compiler is maturing, this maximizes test coverage and avoids tier-specific bugs.

### Phase 0: Inlining (pre-loop)

Before the main optimization loop:

1. **Inline** small static/always_inline functions
2. **mem2reg** re-run to promote allocas from inlined callee entry blocks (now non-entry blocks in caller)
3. **constant_fold + copy_prop + simplify + constant_fold + copy_prop** to resolve arithmetic on inlined constants
4. **resolve_inline_asm_symbols** traces GlobalAddr+GEP/Add/Cast def chains to resolve "i" constraint symbol+offset strings (e.g., `boot_cpu_data+74`) for inline asm inputs that became resolvable after inlining

### Main loop (up to 3 iterations)

The pipeline runs up to 3 iterations, early-exiting if no changes are made:

CFG simplify -> copy prop -> narrow -> simplify -> constant fold -> GVN/CSE -> LICM -> if-convert -> copy prop -> DCE -> CFG simplify -> [IPCP after iter 0]

After the first iteration, IPCP runs to propagate constant returns across function boundaries, then subsequent iterations clean up the resulting dead code.

## Architecture

- All passes use `IrModule::for_each_function()` to iterate over defined functions
- `Instruction::dest()` provides the canonical way to extract a value defined by an instruction
- `IrConst::is_zero()`, `IrConst::is_one()`, `IrConst::zero(ty)`, `IrConst::one(ty)` provide shared constant helpers
- `IrBinOp`, `IrUnaryOp`, `IrCmpOp` derive `Hash`/`Eq` so they can be used directly as HashMap keys (e.g., in GVN)
- `IrConst::to_hash_key()` converts float constants to bit-pattern keys for hashing
- `IrBinOp::is_commutative()` identifies commutative ops for canonical ordering in CSE

## Adding New Passes

Each pass implements `fn run(module: &mut IrModule) -> usize` returning the count of changes made.
Use `module.for_each_function(|func| { ... })` to skip declarations.
Register new passes in `mod.rs::run_passes()` at the appropriate pipeline position.
