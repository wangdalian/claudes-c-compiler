/// Shared constant expression evaluation functions.
///
/// This module extracts the pure constant-evaluation logic that was duplicated
/// between `sema::const_eval` (SemaConstEval) and `ir::lowering::const_eval`
/// (Lowerer). Both evaluate compile-time constant expressions from the same AST,
/// but differ in how they resolve types:
/// - Sema uses CType (C-level types from the type checker)
/// - Lowering uses IrType (IR-level types from the lowerer)
///
/// The functions here are parameterized by closures that abstract over these
/// differences, allowing both callers to share the same evaluation logic for:
/// - Literal evaluation
/// - Builtin function constant folding (__builtin_bswap, __builtin_clz, etc.)
/// - Sub-int promotion for unary operations
/// - Bit-width evaluation through cast chains
///
/// Functions that require caller-specific state (global address resolution,
/// sizeof/alignof, binary operations with type inference) remain in the
/// respective callers.
